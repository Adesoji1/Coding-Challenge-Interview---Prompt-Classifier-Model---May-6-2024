      "I would probably focus a lot of your recruiting at Oregon State, on the assumption there is some population of students there who are from Oregon, want to remain in Oregon, and are paying in-state tuition so they have a slightly lower loan burden.

      "\n",
      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations. A good nonprofit has to be run like a normal for-profit hospital, and then there has to be great fundraising and establishment of trust and engagement with the community. Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org. And of course the Animal Medical Center in NYC and Angell in Boston are two of the largest and oldest specialty hospitals in the country, both also 501(c)(3) orgs.|I am not sure about Australia, but in the US most interventional radiologists are actually not radiologists. Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that. I don't know the pathology dept at NCSU specifically, but most pathology depts are usually pretty welcoming to any students who show real interest in pathology.|You need to put actual numbers in your job ads as a bare minimum to get any interest. For your reference, for last year's graduating class of veterinarians, the mean starting salary for small animal private practice was $133,000 ($112K base plus $21K expected production): [https://www.avma.org/news/veterinary-starting-salaries-rise-2023-educational-debt-holds-steady](https://www.avma.org/news/veterinary-starting-salaries-rise-2023-educational-debt-holds-steady)\n",

      "Daly City has a very high cost of living, quick Google search looks like 60-70% higher than national average depending on source. So I'd be looking for something in the neighborhood of $180,000 base and anticipated $213,000 including production as a bare minimum. And that's for a new graduate, so if you're serious about \"commensurate with experience\" then it should be higher than that for an experienced vet.|That is not unusual in the highest cost of living areas like Daly City (Bay Area) or NYC. In the same way that people in the lowest cost of living parts of the country like Oklahoma are getting offers with base salary in the $70-80K range which is 30% below average (despite cost of living only being 13% lower than national average). Veterinarians devaluing ourselves is definitely part of the problem that perpetuates our low pay relative other equivalently trained healthcare professionals.|Yes, most vets have free time, families, pets, and a life outside of work. It depends of course on what branch of vet med you go into, and to some degree your own job selection (some people are just workaholics), but if when you say \"one of my parents works in human medicine\" you mean that they are a physician or work a physician's schedule, then you probably have a good idea of the time commitment. An average small animal clinical vet might have a schedule that looks like 4 weekday 10 hour shifts, a rotating weekend schedule that might be one Saturday per month, and likely 3-4 weeks vacation per year. Many vets end up having to spend extra time after their shift end to finish paperwork and do some client callbacks, so on average 40-50 hours per week actually working plus their weekend rotation. \n",
      "\n",
      "And as I said, there's a very wide range depending on what area of vet med you go into. Some people might be ER vets, pulling 12-14 hour shifts for 3 days in row then have like a week off. Some might be specialist surgeons or neurologists, so they have to be on call for emergency surgery which can be very disruptive to routine life but comes with high pay. Some might work industry or government jobs and have a very predictable 9-5, M-F schedule. Some might be full time teleradiologists who work 25 hours total per week, all from home.|There's some imprecision/hand-waving in the description here. 6-12 months is a wide range. If you make 80k in 6 months, that's 160k for a year which is higher than the average vet salary in the US right now. 80k in 12 months would be more like the bottom of the range for a new grad in small animal private practice. You should ensure there is a clear date at which you switch from your \"introductory\" pay you your regular base/production or whatever.\n",
      "\n",
      "What you've described isn't really an \"internship\" at least not in the traditional sense in vet med. An internship should be rotating, meaning you spend weeks at a time working in different specialty services under the tutelage of board-certified vets, usually at minimum Internal Medicine, Surgery, and ECC (but usually much more, such as Neuro, Cardio, Onco, Anesthesia, Ophtho, Derm, Radiology, etc. depending on how large the specialty hospital is). To me, it sounds like this job is using the word \"internship\" to justify low salary for the first year, when most new grads are not expected to be fast/efficient/productive.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that is fine, so long as the salary is not markedly below market for whatever area you're looking at (i.e. 80k is totally fine for Oklahoma, but certifiably low-income in NYC). You should also ensure that the \"mentorship\" aspect is well defined in your contract, and that the consequences if they should fail to live up to the mentorship aspect are also spelled out in the contract.|In general the requirement for teleradiology will be board certification by either the ACVR or ECVDI and a license to practice veterinary medicine where you live. Most of the large global teleradiology companies pay quite well (in the US most full-time teleradiologists will make in the range of $300-600K (USD) annually. I think most of the large global teleradiology companies (Antech, IDEXX, VetCT, etc.) might have a slight differential pay for their radiologists based on cost of living in their country of residence, but I am not totally sure about that. It won't be a big difference, though, because they don't want to discourage radiologists from living in time zones with reduced coverage (most of their radiologists will be in the North American and Western European time zones, so coverage in Asia/Australia tends to be poor).|I don't know any veterinary or human radiologists who are concerned about AI taking our jobs in our lifetime. Perhaps we are all collectively delusional, but I doubt it. For your consideration: In order for AI to \"replace\" a radiologist, the company who owns the AI product would need to accept liability for interpretation errors made by their AI.|Plenty of people do a mid-career switch to vet med. There were two students in my class in their 50s, and several in their 30s and 40s. Really the biggest question is financial. If you’ve made enough money in your career up to now that you can fund the educational path without loans, you are good to go. If you need to take out major loans, then you’ll have to do some number crunching to figure out if you can make it work. Figure you’ll need 2-3 years to complete your academic and veterinary experience prerequisites, then 4 years of school means you’ll be in your mid-40s when you graduate. Tuition for 4 years will be $200-300K (depending on if you get into your in-state school). Most people need to budget another $100-150K for living expenses, but presumably your calculation will be different depending on your personal situation (Own your own home? Have a spouse/partner with a job? Have kids? Etc). \n",
      "\n",
      "Graduation in your mid-40s you’ll have about 20-25 years of working as a vet. Current new graduates in small animal private practice are averaging about $133K for their first contract. That will be up a bit in 8 years (although tuition and living expenses may also be higher than the figures I listed). Many vets these days have trouble paying off their loans in 20-25 years and may go for an income-based repayment plan (in which the balance of your loans are forgiven after 20 or 25 years). So if at age 40 you are entering vet school in the same financial situation as the typical 22 year old student, you may end up spending your entire career as a vet paying off the loans.|The ones I remember were the Nextel phones.

Chances are the 2024 graduates will be a little higher. Also, that $133K number is the average for the whole country, meaning a good number of new grads are above that.

So you will need to demonstrate that you have a plan in place for how to grow the business/caseload to make it worthwhile. You will likely need to hire at least one additional tech (CVT ideally) and likely also at least one additional vet assistant. You should ensure your business plan can accommodate the new hires, and be prepared to include it in the contract with the new vet.\n",

On average, most specialists (we are talking common clinical small animal specialties working in private practice) will make 2-3x the average GP and probably 1.5-2x the average ER (non-boarded) vet.

Those working full time teleradiology are making that amount for about 30 hours/week (and no commute). Those working full time in-house practice are making less, maybe $300-350K for 40-50 hours. Not bad at all, but comparable to other clinical specialties as opposed to absurd teleradiology bubble salary. One big advantage of radiology, of course, is that due to the lack of client contact and no need for referral letters, callbacks, sitting around talking about cases, and other such \"non-revenue generating\" activities, almost all the hours worked are productive.|According to the VIRMP site:\n",
      "\n",
      ">Commitment Process:  \n",
      "One of the most important aspects of participation in the VIRMP is the early commitment which is made by the applicant; that is, the applicant must agree to accept a position at any of the institutions or private practices which he/she ranked. When creating an account, the applicant will electronically sign an agreement to this effect. Failure to comply will result in sanctions including a ban from participation in the VIRMP for at least 3 years. This agreement must be completed online no later than February 16, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the deadline to withdraw has already passed. The match is not a traditional job offer/acceptance situation. When you signed the electronic commitment, that was your acceptance of whatever \"job offer\" is assigned to you by the match program. You have already accepted any potential job offer from all the internship programs you decided to apply for. You are already past the point of having the option to reject an internship \"offer\" without penalty.|There's no specific timeline after the match. Essentially, at some point in the days/weeks after the match, your internship institution should contact you and provide information regarding starting dates, orientation schedule, state licensing info (if needed), and to request any personal information they need for employment/HR purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are going to reject the internship, out of professional courtesy you should do that ASAP when you get your match result. You will still be penalized by the VIRMP with the 3 year freeze, and you likely will go on a Do Not Hire list at the institution, but you at least give the institution the opportunity to scramble and find a replacement for the internship spot you are vacating. \n",
      "\n",
      "You should probably be aware also that even after the 3 year VIRMP freeze, you would be seriously damaging your chances of ever matching in the future. Vet Med is a surprisingly small world, and many people (especially in academia) are well connected. Your decision to reject an internship after the match will reflect poorly on the faculty who wrote your reference letters, and they will almost certainly not agree to write you another letter if you decide to reapply in the future. Chances are none of your other current faculty would be comfortable writing a letter for you after a 3 year hiatus (especially knowing the reason for the hiatus). So during those three years you would need to establish new positive working relationships, ideally with boarded specialists, who would write your reference letters and directly address your previous actions. Even then, many internship programs would likely view your application with a very big red flag, unless there was an extenuating circumstance like an immediate family member fell ill and you had to pause/upend your career path in order to take care of them.|If you have the time and money to spend on training to be a CVT, it's fine. But don't approach it like a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a vet. It would be like becoming a Registered Nurse as a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a Medical Doctor. Essentially, you should view it as a backup career option, which is not totally unreasonable as the acceptance rate for vet school is like 8-12%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that although there is overlap in knowledge between the two careers, most of the classes you take aren't applicable to vet school pre-reqs (as far as I'm aware). So after you got your CVT, you would then need to go back to school and take all the vet school requirements. Furthermore, it is generally advantageous to have varied animal/industry experience, not just all small animal clinical experience. Do you know how many vet school applicants are small animal clinical vet techs/assistants? Like, almost all of them. It's very hard to differentiate yourself when you're an Animal Science major and working as a small animal vet tech/assistant like 90% of the applicants. Vet schools like to see people with experience in large/farm animal, exotics, lab animal, wildlife, etc. \n",
      "\n",

There's the adage of needing 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something, but what's usually lost from that concept is that it's 10,000 hours of \\*\\*guided\\*\\* practice. That is, being supervised by a teacher, trainer, coach, etc. to correct your mistakes and reinforce your successes. Without the guidance, you are very likely just reinforcing your bad habits. I have met many GPs and ER vets with years of experience who \\*think\\* they are good at rads, but in reality are probably worse than an average vet student who just finished their radiology rotation. To take it a step further, even radiologists who are working solo and/or teleradiology exclusive and therefore very rarely getting second opinions on their reads or followup from surgeons and pathologists also end up reinforcing bad habits. Without surgeons and pathologists to keep us honest, we may as well believe we have a 100% accuracy rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the hardest part about learning to read radiographs is being able to differentiate normal from abnormal. This is a lot harder than it sounds, because there is a very wide range of \"normal\" and it overlaps with a lot of \"abnormal.\" And what I mean by normal is \"no clinically significant abnormalities\", which is different from \"textbook normal.\" A prime example of this is abdominal radiographs on a patient with acute vomiting and diarrhea. Most of the time, I read these out as normal abdomen. The intern or ER doc may then come and ask, so these don't look like gastroenteritis? To which I ask, what are the radiographic signs of gastroenteritis? And they don't answer, because of course there aren't really any specific radiographic signs of gastroenteritis. I may see some things that I associate more often with gastroenteritis — fragmented gas pattern in the jejunum, diffuse gas dilation of the GI tract, etc. — and if the clinical history fits I may conclude acute gastroenteritis so the ordering clinician feels better about their workup. But in reality, those radiographic signs are pretty common in animals with no GI symptoms at all, so it wouldn't be wrong to just conclude \"normal abdomen.\" The goal of abdominal rads in the acutely vomiting animal is not to rule \\*\\*in\\*\\* gastroenteritis, it is to rule \\*\\*out\\*\\* mechanical obstruction, radiopaque foreign material, or other gross abnormalities like abdominal mass effect or ascites. \"Normal abdomen\" effectively rules those things out, leaving you with a provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis so long as the remainder of the clinical picture fits (i.e., not in acute renal failure, liver failure, Addisonian crisis, etc.). \n",
      "\n",
      "So ultimately this is where reading textbooks like Thrall is useful, even if the example images aren't amazing. You learn what the actual radiographic signs are that are classically associated with disease processes. There isn't really a better overall textbook out there than Thrall. For thorax specifically though, I like the BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Thoracic Imaging: [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/BSAVA+Manual+of+Canine+and+Feline+Thoracic+Imaging-p-9780905214979](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/bsava+manual+of+canine+and+feline+thoracic+imaging-p-9780905214979) It's a little bit dated (published 2008) but it's not like there have been major advances in thoracic radiography since then.

I've never even owned a dog.|With the understanding that this Reddit post is not a job ad, biggest immediate red flag is “competitive wage.” Everyone says that, I’ve never seen any job ad that declares their salary not to be competitive. There’s a shortage of vets, and we’re inundated with recruiting emails. It’s not uncommon for us to simply delete/ignore any ads that don’t list an actual salary range. For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location. Including production, I would bet it’s not unusual for vets in OR to be making $180-200K. \n",

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go.

      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices.

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that.

They are generally customized for an individual resident, and the \"alternative\" aspect is usually that the supervising radiologists will be spread out over 2 or more institutions rather than all in one location. There is still a requirement that a residency director be on location at the primary hospital for at least 50% of the time, and at least one other supervising radiologist (but typically more than one) be available for immediate live clinical consultation/interaction the rest of the time (usually meaning the resident goes to a different hospital with a radiologist, or the other radiologist is a contracted locum at the primary hospital, but technically could also be a virtual locum on a Zoom call all day). \n",

There is still a requirement of at least 2 boarded radiologists to establish an alternative track residency, so if you are restricted in not being able to leave your geographic area, there needs to be two radiologists within your radius who agree to take on this task of training you.|What niche branch/specialty are you talking about? It likely varies to some degree from specialty to specialty.\n",

      "That said, it also varies quite a bit from program to program. *Most* residencies will likely use GPA/rank more as a tier system than a straight rank (e.g., top quartile of class, second quartile, etc.).

If the latter, absolutely you need to be a boarded specialist.

The WBS has one full time staff veterinarian. She is not a board-certified specialist, but has a lot of wildlife/avian related experience including an internship at a wildlife center.

Realistically, in order to lose a case like that, you'd have to have a radiologist willing to testify that your miss was a major error that affected the outcome of the case and that a general practitioner should be expected to identify. Any doctor, radiologist or not, who claims that loss of serosal detail in the right cranial quadrant is a sure sign of pancreatitis that shouldn't be missed is full of shit. As a radiologist, I am well aware of all the classical radiographic signs of pancreatitis, and anecdotally based on followup abdominal ultrasounds in these cases I can confidently say the classical signs of pancreatitis on radiographs are both poorly sensitive and poorly specific. I am generally actually hesitant to even teach people the radiographic signs, because it probably just means more vets will be misdiagnosing pancreatitis.\n",

That's, like, relatively high. So chances are non-radiologists would have a significantly higher rate of major errors. I still wouldn't be overly concerned about being sued, as your error would have to be pretty egregious for a radiologist to testify that you should be penalized for it, but as a matter of basic medical standard and patient care you should maybe be concerned.

I think the more modern mindset is that every negative explore is a diagnostic failure. Cost of further diagnostics is certainly a consideration for our clients compared to human med, but if you had a complaint of vomiting and abdominal pain and went to the ER, and their initial imaging screening was inconclusive, I would bet you wouldn't seriously consider letting them do a diagnostic laparotomy on you in lieu of further imaging. I think so long as the pet owners understand that there are other noninvasive but perhaps less timely and more costly options available, and they are giving well informed consent to the exploratory, that's fine.|Challenging is very subjective and individual.

      "\n",
      "1. Applicants who have years of experience in lieu of a rotating internship are generally at a disadvantage. The key is what the nature of your experience is. If you're working for 3 years as an ER vet in a referral hospital with all the standard specialties that one would have at a rotating internship, that is good experience. If you're working for 2 years in a general practice with minimal to no direct exposure to (boarded) specialists, that's bad experience. \n",
      "2. An internship recognized by EBVS is *probably* valid, but I would guess it is viewed as second tier unless it is well enough known as to be internationally reputable.\n",
      "3. Recs from vets in the UK would hold weight, so long as the vets are boarded specialists. DACVS probably holds more weight than DECVS, but only by a little.\n",
      "4. I have no idea how you would get involved in publishing something at a private clinic. It really just depends on whether you have contact with a boarded specialist who is willing to co-author the paper with you.\n",
      "5. The surgery diploma may help a little bit, but not much. Any ACVS residency is likely to be quite skeptical of the diploma/certificate, since they don't really know how rigorous the criteria are for passing. It would likely simply be viewed as \"candidate demonstrates an interest in small animal surgery.\"\n",
      "6. GPA comparison is very challenging unless the residency happens to have a faculty surgeon who is familiar with your school. If a class rank is available and can be shared as part of your application, that may hold more weight than straight GPA.\n",
      "7. They won't skip over your application without ECFVG/NAVLE, but you are likely at some kind of disadvantage without it. Also note that without ECFVG/NAVLE, even if you pass your boards you would be restricted to working at a university teaching hospital in the US.\n",
      "8. The most important part of the residency application is your references. Ideally, if you can find a surgeon (or two) who are double boarded in ACVS and ECVS to write letters, that's the best thing you can do. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the thing that residencies want to know is whether you will pass your boards and whether you will be a functional part of a surgery department for the 3 years of residency. The best way for them to know this is by having references from DACVS vets who know the candidate well and can vouch for their ability to survive a residency. This is the reason why DACVS references are preferred – they have been through the residency and passed the ACVS boards. DECVS may be perfectly knowledgeable and skilled surgeons, but they have not gone through an ACVS residency and passed those boards. There is an assumption that the two are probably close enough that a DECVS can evaluate whether a candidate is residency material, but again, if you have no DACVS references you are likely at a disadvantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the internship vs experience and the utility of the 1 year surgery diploma/certificate, ultimately the problem is that this is \"nontraditional\" for a candidate for an ACVS residency. There are many, many qualified applicants with a more traditional education/training background, many more than the number of residency spots. Last year, there were 238 applicants for 54 spots, with a match rate of 22.27%. More than 4 applicants for every 1 spot. And the vast majority of those applicants went to an AVMA-Accredited school, did a rotating internship in the US or Canada, and the vast majority of successful applicants also have one or more surgical internships as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "ACVS residencies have decided that this background – good grades at accredited school, rotating internship, surgical internship, multiple good DACVS references – is a good predictor of success for a resident. And there are more applicants who fit this profile than there are residency spots. So for you to supplant one of those candidates as a Spanish vet school grad, with no rotating internship, no surgical internship, and no DACVS references, you basically have to be a total rock star of a surgery candidate, and your DECVS references will need to say so emphatically.|\"Recognized\" is a nebulous word. Because vet med is minimally regulated in the US, anybody can do anything once they have a license. There are plenty of self-styled orthopedic \"specialists\" who have never been through a residency and are certainly not board-certified surgeons. But are boarded European specialists generally considered equivalent to the American specialist counterparts? Yes. At least in radiology, for example, a DECVDI is counted as a DACVR equivalent for the purpose of ACVR residency accreditation. Mind you, we are talking about boarded specialists here, not the Advanced Practitioner certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "To work as a vet in the US, you either have to have passed your NAVLE, or you have to work under the umbrella license of a university teaching hospital. This applies to boarded specialists as well. Having a DECVS or DECVDI does not allow you to bypass the need for a valid medical license. So if you are a DECVS who has not passed the NAVLE (either directly or after having gone through ECFVG or PAVE certification first), your only option is to work at a university. That said, there are many such European specialists working at universities, because academia pays like crap so it's hard to attract and retain faculty. \n",

      "I think that if your general vet med education is still fresh in your mind, and your plan (being a US citizen) is to live/work in the US permanently, it would be advisable to go through the ECFVG.

      "Beyond that, though, what is the clinic organization and working conditions? 20% ownership at signing and \"can change the name to whatever they want\" suggests this new employee has immediate full control of the practice itself. To me this sounds like there's one vet who owns the clinic is looking to retire, allowing the new vet to rename/rebrand however they like. Most people these days are looking to work in a larger team environment, as opposed to being effectively a solo practitioner. This also begs the question of how many support staff are there for the X number of vets? Especially how many RVTs, how many VAs, how many kennel attendants, how many receptionists, and is there a practice manager?|There are no reliable data, that I'm aware of. And salaries across the board in vet med have changed drastically since the pandemic, so any data you find from 2020 or earlier is likely so outdated as to be totally useless at this point.

Veterinary radiology tech backgrounds run the gamut: vet assistants who are trained on-the-job to acquire imaging studies, registered vet techs (RVT) who are trained on-the-job and who may progress to vet tech specialization (VTS, involves benchmarks for experience and then passing a certifying exam), human medical radiologic technologists (RT) who shift to vet med part time or full time, human medical registered diagnostic medical sonographers (RDMS) who shift to vet med part time or full time. \n",

I graduated from college in the late 90s, had several family members who were MDs including my father and a couple of my older cousins. So I kind of knew where medicine was headed, and I also really disliked the pre-med students in college, and didn't want to spend my life calling them my colleagues. One of my friends was pre-vet, and she was pretty cool, so I switched sides (took a couple years off after college to pursue other random things but eventually settled on vet school).|Starting salary for a small animal private practice GP is about $130k right now, so the simple math says yes, the two additional years of working salary is worth the higher tuition.|That starts getting complicated. So if we assume 10% interest rate (which is higher than it is right now, I think), over 7 years you accrue $106k on a $270k loan, bringing you up to $376k when you finish in the US. On a $400k loan over 5 years at 10%, you accrue $109k in interest, putting you at $509k when you finish in the UK. That's a difference of $133k. In order for you to bridge that gap in the two years of working, you'd need to put in somewhere around $6k per month towards your loans.\n",

      "There's a lot of variables, though, which can result in a significant change in the calculation. Obviously, the real cost of attendance is a big one, so if real cost of attendance in the UK is lower than you estimate, or the cost in the US is higher than you estimate, that will be a big change. Also whatever is that actual interest rate you get will make a big difference.

For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location.

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that. I don't know the pathology dept at NCSU specifically, but most pathology depts are usually pretty welcoming to any students who show real interest in pathology.|You need to put actual numbers in your job ads as a bare minimum to get any interest.

And that's for a new graduate, so if you're serious about \"commensurate with experience\" then it should be higher than that for an experienced vet.|That is not unusual in the highest cost of living areas like Daly City (Bay Area) or NYC. In the same way that people in the lowest cost of living parts of the country like Oklahoma are getting offers with base salary in the $70-80K range which is 30% below average (despite cost of living only being 13% lower than national average). Veterinarians devaluing ourselves is definitely part of the problem that perpetuates our low pay relative other equivalently trained healthcare professionals.|Yes, most vets have free time, families, pets, and a life outside of work. It depends of course on what branch of vet med you go into, and to some degree your own job selection (some people are just workaholics), but if when you say \"one of my parents works in human medicine\" you mean that they are a physician or work a physician's schedule, then you probably have a good idea of the time commitment. An average small animal clinical vet might have a schedule that looks like 4 weekday 10 hour shifts, a rotating weekend schedule that might be one Saturday per month, and likely 3-4 weeks vacation per year. Many vets end up having to spend extra time after their shift end to finish paperwork and do some client callbacks, so on average 40-50 hours per week actually working plus their weekend rotation. \n",

      "And as I said, there's a very wide range depending on what area of vet med you go into. Some people might be ER vets, pulling 12-14 hour shifts for 3 days in row then have like a week off. Some might be specialist surgeons or neurologists, so they have to be on call for emergency surgery which can be very disruptive to routine life but comes with high pay. Some might work industry or government jobs and have a very predictable 9-5, M-F schedule. Some might be full time teleradiologists who work 25 hours total per week, all from home.|There's some imprecision/hand-waving in the description here. 6-12 months is a wide range.

Most of the large global teleradiology companies pay quite well (in the US most full-time teleradiologists will make in the range of $300-600K (USD) annually. I think most of the large global teleradiology companies (Antech, IDEXX, VetCT, etc.) might have a slight differential pay for their radiologists based on cost of living in their country of residence, but I am not totally sure about that. It won't be a big difference, though, because they don't want to discourage radiologists from living in time zones with reduced coverage (most of their radiologists will be in the North American and Western European time zones, so coverage in Asia/Australia tends to be poor).|I don't know any veterinary or human radiologists who are concerned about AI taking our jobs in our lifetime. Perhaps we are all collectively delusional, but I doubt it.

There were two students in my class in their 50s, and several in their 30s and 40s. Really the biggest question is financial. If you’ve made enough money in your career up to now that you can fund the educational path without loans, you are good to go. If you need to take out major loans, then you’ll have to do some number crunching to figure out if you can make it work. Figure you’ll need 2-3 years to complete your academic and veterinary experience prerequisites, then 4 years of school means you’ll be in your mid-40s when you graduate. Tuition for 4 years will be $200-300K (depending on if you get into your in-state school). Most people need to budget another $100-150K for living expenses, but presumably your calculation will be different depending on your personal situation (Own your own home? Have a spouse/partner with a job? Have kids? Etc). \n",

That will be up a bit in 8 years (although tuition and living expenses may also be higher than the figures I listed). Many vets these days have trouble paying off their loans in 20-25 years and may go for an income-based repayment plan (in which the balance of your loans are forgiven after 20 or 25 years). So if at age 40 you are entering vet school in the same financial situation as the typical 22 year old student, you may end up spending your entire career as a vet paying off the loans.|The ones I remember were the Nextel phones.

      "\n",
      ">Commitment Process:  \n",
      "One of the most important aspects of participation in the VIRMP is the early commitment which is made by the applicant; that is, the applicant must agree to accept a position at any of the institutions or private practices which he/she ranked. When creating an account, the applicant will electronically sign an agreement to this effect. Failure to comply will result in sanctions including a ban from participation in the VIRMP for at least 3 years. This agreement must be completed online no later than February 16, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the deadline to withdraw has already passed. The match is not a traditional job offer/acceptance situation. When you signed the electronic commitment, that was your acceptance of whatever \"job offer\" is assigned to you by the match program. You have already accepted any potential job offer from all the internship programs you decided to apply for. You are already past the point of having the option to reject an internship \"offer\" without penalty.|There's no specific timeline after the match. Essentially, at some point in the days/weeks after the match, your internship institution should contact you and provide information regarding starting dates, orientation schedule, state licensing info (if needed), and to request any personal information they need for employment/HR purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are going to reject the internship, out of professional courtesy you should do that ASAP when you get your match result. You will still be penalized by the VIRMP with the 3 year freeze, and you likely will go on a Do Not Hire list at the institution, but you at least give the institution the opportunity to scramble and find a replacement for the internship spot you are vacating. \n",
      "\n",
      "You should probably be aware also that even after the 3 year VIRMP freeze, you would be seriously damaging your chances of ever matching in the future. Vet Med is a surprisingly small world, and many people (especially in academia) are well connected. Your decision to reject an internship after the match will reflect poorly on the faculty who wrote your reference letters, and they will almost certainly not agree to write you another letter if you decide to reapply in the future. Chances are none of your other current faculty would be comfortable writing a letter for you after a 3 year hiatus (especially knowing the reason for the hiatus). So during those three years you would need to establish new positive working relationships, ideally with boarded specialists, who would write your reference letters and directly address your previous actions. Even then, many internship programs would likely view your application with a very big red flag, unless there was an extenuating circumstance like an immediate family member fell ill and you had to pause/upend your career path in order to take care of them.|If you have the time and money to spend on training to be a CVT, it's fine. But don't approach it like a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a vet. It would be like becoming a Registered Nurse as a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a Medical Doctor. Essentially, you should view it as a backup career option, which is not totally unreasonable as the acceptance rate for vet school is like 8-12%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that although there is overlap in knowledge between the two careers, most of the classes you take aren't applicable to vet school pre-reqs (as far as I'm aware). So after you got your CVT, you would then need to go back to school and take all the vet school requirements. Furthermore, it is generally advantageous to have varied animal/industry experience, not just all small animal clinical experience. Do you know how many vet school applicants are small animal clinical vet techs/assistants? Like, almost all of them. It's very hard to differentiate yourself when you're an Animal Science major and working as a small animal vet tech/assistant like 90% of the applicants.

There's the adage of needing 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something, but what's usually lost from that concept is that it's 10,000 hours of \\*\\*guided\\*\\* practice. That is, being supervised by a teacher, trainer, coach, etc. to correct your mistakes and reinforce your successes. Without the guidance, you are very likely just reinforcing your bad habits. I have met many GPs and ER vets with years of experience who \\*think\\* they are good at rads, but in reality are probably worse than an average vet student who just finished their radiology rotation. To take it a step further, even radiologists who are working solo and/or teleradiology exclusive and therefore very rarely getting second opinions on their reads or followup from surgeons and pathologists also end up reinforcing bad habits. Without surgeons and pathologists to keep us honest, we may as well believe we have a 100% accuracy rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the hardest part about learning to read radiographs is being able to differentiate normal from abnormal. This is a lot harder than it sounds, because there is a very wide range of \"normal\" and it overlaps with a lot of \"abnormal.\" And what I mean by normal is \"no clinically significant abnormalities\", which is different from \"textbook normal.\" A prime example of this is abdominal radiographs on a patient with acute vomiting and diarrhea. Most of the time, I read these out as normal abdomen. The intern or ER doc may then come and ask, so these don't look like gastroenteritis? To which I ask, what are the radiographic signs of gastroenteritis? And they don't answer, because of course there aren't really any specific radiographic signs of gastroenteritis. I may see some things that I associate more often with gastroenteritis — fragmented gas pattern in the jejunum, diffuse gas dilation of the GI tract, etc. — and if the clinical history fits I may conclude acute gastroenteritis so the ordering clinician feels better about their workup. But in reality, those radiographic signs are pretty common in animals with no GI symptoms at all, so it wouldn't be wrong to just conclude \"normal abdomen.\" The goal of abdominal rads in the acutely vomiting animal is not to rule \\*\\*in\\*\\* gastroenteritis, it is to rule \\*\\*out\\*\\* mechanical obstruction, radiopaque foreign material, or other gross abnormalities like abdominal mass effect or ascites. \"Normal abdomen\" effectively rules those things out, leaving you with a provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis so long as the remainder of the clinical picture fits (i.e., not in acute renal failure, liver failure, Addisonian crisis, etc.). \n",

I've never even owned a dog.|With the understanding that this Reddit post is not a job ad, biggest immediate red flag is “competitive wage.” Everyone says that, I’ve never seen any job ad that declares their salary not to be competitive. There’s a shortage of vets, and we’re inundated with recruiting emails. It’s not uncommon for us to simply delete/ignore any ads that don’t list an actual salary range. For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location. Including production, I would bet it’s not unusual for vets in OR to be making $180-200K. \n",

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go.

      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio.

Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices.

For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that.

They are generally customized for an individual resident, and the \"alternative\" aspect is usually that the supervising radiologists will be spread out over 2 or more institutions rather than all in one location. There is still a requirement that a residency director be on location at the primary hospital for at least 50% of the time, and at least one other supervising radiologist (but typically more than one) be available for immediate live clinical consultation/interaction the rest of the time (usually meaning the resident goes to a different hospital with a radiologist, or the other radiologist is a contracted locum at the primary hospital, but technically could also be a virtual locum on a Zoom call all day). \n",

There is still a requirement of at least 2 boarded radiologists to establish an alternative track residency, so if you are restricted in not being able to leave your geographic area, there needs to be two radiologists within your radius who agree to take on this task of training you.|What niche branch/specialty are you talking about? It likely varies to some degree from specialty to specialty.\n",

The WBS has one full time staff veterinarian. She is not a board-certified specialist, but has a lot of wildlife/avian related experience including an internship at a wildlife center.

Realistically, in order to lose a case like that, you'd have to have a radiologist willing to testify that your miss was a major error that affected the outcome of the case and that a general practitioner should be expected to identify. Any doctor, radiologist or not, who claims that loss of serosal detail in the right cranial quadrant is a sure sign of pancreatitis that shouldn't be missed is full of shit. As a radiologist, I am well aware of all the classical radiographic signs of pancreatitis, and anecdotally based on followup abdominal ultrasounds in these cases I can confidently say the classical signs of pancreatitis on radiographs are both poorly sensitive and poorly specific. I am generally actually hesitant to even teach people the radiographic signs, because it probably just means more vets will be misdiagnosing pancreatitis.\n",

That's, like, relatively high. So chances are non-radiologists would have a significantly higher rate of major errors. I still wouldn't be overly concerned about being sued, as your error would have to be pretty egregious for a radiologist to testify that you should be penalized for it, but as a matter of basic medical standard and patient care you should maybe be concerned.

I think the more modern mindset is that every negative explore is a diagnostic failure. Cost of further diagnostics is certainly a consideration for our clients compared to human med, but if you had a complaint of vomiting and abdominal pain and went to the ER, and their initial imaging screening was inconclusive, I would bet you wouldn't seriously consider letting them do a diagnostic laparotomy on you in lieu of further imaging.

      "\n",
      "1. Applicants who have years of experience in lieu of a rotating internship are generally at a disadvantage. The key is what the nature of your experience is. If you're working for 3 years as an ER vet in a referral hospital with all the standard specialties that one would have at a rotating internship, that is good experience. If you're working for 2 years in a general practice with minimal to no direct exposure to (boarded) specialists, that's bad experience. \n",
      "2. An internship recognized by EBVS is *probably* valid, but I would guess it is viewed as second tier unless it is well enough known as to be internationally reputable.\n",
      "3. Recs from vets in the UK would hold weight, so long as the vets are boarded specialists. DACVS probably holds more weight than DECVS, but only by a little.\n",
      "4. I have no idea how you would get involved in publishing something at a private clinic. It really just depends on whether you have contact with a boarded specialist who is willing to co-author the paper with you.\n",
      "5. The surgery diploma may help a little bit, but not much. Any ACVS residency is likely to be quite skeptical of the diploma/certificate, since they don't really know how rigorous the criteria are for passing. It would likely simply be viewed as \"candidate demonstrates an interest in small animal surgery.\"\n",
      "6. GPA comparison is very challenging unless the residency happens to have a faculty surgeon who is familiar with your school. If a class rank is available and can be shared as part of your application, that may hold more weight than straight GPA.\n",
      "7. They won't skip over your application without ECFVG/NAVLE, but you are likely at some kind of disadvantage without it. Also note that without ECFVG/NAVLE, even if you pass your boards you would be restricted to working at a university teaching hospital in the US.\n",
      "8. The most important part of the residency application is your references. Ideally, if you can find a surgeon (or two) who are double boarded in ACVS and ECVS to write letters, that's the best thing you can do. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the thing that residencies want to know is whether you will pass your boards and whether you will be a functional part of a surgery department for the 3 years of residency. The best way for them to know this is by having references from DACVS vets who know the candidate well and can vouch for their ability to survive a residency. This is the reason why DACVS references are preferred – they have been through the residency and passed the ACVS boards. DECVS may be perfectly knowledgeable and skilled surgeons, but they have not gone through an ACVS residency and passed those boards. There is an assumption that the two are probably close enough that a DECVS can evaluate whether a candidate is residency material, but again, if you have no DACVS references you are likely at a disadvantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the internship vs experience and the utility of the 1 year surgery diploma/certificate, ultimately the problem is that this is \"nontraditional\" for a candidate for an ACVS residency. There are many, many qualified applicants with a more traditional education/training background, many more than the number of residency spots. Last year, there were 238 applicants for 54 spots, with a match rate of 22.27%. More than 4 applicants for every 1 spot. And the vast majority of those applicants went to an AVMA-Accredited school, did a rotating internship in the US or Canada, and the vast majority of successful applicants also have one or more surgical internships as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "ACVS residencies have decided that this background – good grades at accredited school, rotating internship, surgical internship, multiple good DACVS references – is a good predictor of success for a resident. And there are more applicants who fit this profile than there are residency spots. So for you to supplant one of those candidates as a Spanish vet school grad, with no rotating internship, no surgical internship, and no DACVS references, you basically have to be a total rock star of a surgery candidate, and your DECVS references will need to say so emphatically.|\"Recognized\" is a nebulous word. Because vet med is minimally regulated in the US, anybody can do anything once they have a license. There are plenty of self-styled orthopedic \"specialists\" who have never been through a residency and are certainly not board-certified surgeons. But are boarded European specialists generally considered equivalent to the American specialist counterparts? Yes. At least in radiology, for example, a DECVDI is counted as a DACVR equivalent for the purpose of ACVR residency accreditation. Mind you, we are talking about boarded specialists here, not the Advanced Practitioner certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "To work as a vet in the US, you either have to have passed your NAVLE, or you have to work under the umbrella license of a university teaching hospital. This applies to boarded specialists as well. Having a DECVS or DECVDI does not allow you to bypass the need for a valid medical license. So if you are a DECVS who has not passed the NAVLE (either directly or after having gone through ECFVG or PAVE certification first), your only option is to work at a university. That said, there are many such European specialists working at universities, because academia pays like crap so it's hard to attract and retain faculty. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think that if your general vet med education is still fresh in your mind, and your plan (being a US citizen) is to live/work in the US permanently, it would be advisable to go through the ECFVG. Even with the cost, you will make a LOT more money if you have the ability to work in private practice, whether as a GP, an ER vet, or a specialist.|As many have already noted, the salary is pretty low. $125K is the mean starting salary for 2023 new graduates in private practice.

      "Beyond that, though, what is the clinic organization and working conditions? 20% ownership at signing and \"can change the name to whatever they want\" suggests this new employee has immediate full control of the practice itself. To me this sounds like there's one vet who owns the clinic is looking to retire, allowing the new vet to rename/rebrand however they like. Most people these days are looking to work in a larger team environment, as opposed to being effectively a solo practitioner. This also begs the question of how many support staff are there for the X number of vets? Especially how many RVTs, how many VAs, how many kennel attendants, how many receptionists, and is there a practice manager?|There are no reliable data, that I'm aware of. And salaries across the board in vet med have changed drastically since the pandemic, so any data you find from 2020 or earlier is likely so outdated as to be totally useless at this point.

I would guess the average cardiologist makes around $350K, and I personally know cardiologists making over $400K, which is probably mid-upper range for private practice.

Veterinary radiology tech backgrounds run the gamut: vet assistants who are trained on-the-job to acquire imaging studies, registered vet techs (RVT) who are trained on-the-job and who may progress to vet tech specialization (VTS, involves benchmarks for experience and then passing a certifying exam), human medical radiologic technologists (RT) who shift to vet med part time or full time, human medical registered diagnostic medical sonographers (RDMS) who shift to vet med part time or full time. \n",

I graduated from college in the late 90s, had several family members who were MDs including my father and a couple of my older cousins. So I kind of knew where medicine was headed, and I also really disliked the pre-med students in college, and didn't want to spend my life calling them my colleagues. One of my friends was pre-vet, and she was pretty cool, so I switched sides (took a couple years off after college to pursue other random things but eventually settled on vet school).|Starting salary for a small animal private practice GP is about $130k right now, so the simple math says yes, the two additional years of working salary is worth the higher tuition.|That starts getting complicated. So if we assume 10% interest rate (which is higher than it is right now, I think), over 7 years you accrue $106k on a $270k loan, bringing you up to $376k when you finish in the US. On a $400k loan over 5 years at 10%, you accrue $109k in interest, putting you at $509k when you finish in the UK. That's a difference of $133k. In order for you to bridge that gap in the two years of working, you'd need to put in somewhere around $6k per month towards your loans.\n",

      "There's a lot of variables, though, which can result in a significant change in the calculation. Obviously, the real cost of attendance is a big one, so if real cost of attendance in the UK is lower than you estimate, or the cost in the US is higher than you estimate, that will be a big change. Also whatever is that actual interest rate you get will make a big difference.

For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location.

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that. I don't know the pathology dept at NCSU specifically, but most pathology depts are usually pretty welcoming to any students who show real interest in pathology.|You need to put actual numbers in your job ads as a bare minimum to get any interest.

And that's for a new graduate, so if you're serious about \"commensurate with experience\" then it should be higher than that for an experienced vet.|That is not unusual in the highest cost of living areas like Daly City (Bay Area) or NYC. In the same way that people in the lowest cost of living parts of the country like Oklahoma are getting offers with base salary in the $70-80K range which is 30% below average (despite cost of living only being 13% lower than national average). Veterinarians devaluing ourselves is definitely part of the problem that perpetuates our low pay relative other equivalently trained healthcare professionals.|Yes, most vets have free time, families, pets, and a life outside of work. It depends of course on what branch of vet med you go into, and to some degree your own job selection (some people are just workaholics), but if when you say \"one of my parents works in human medicine\" you mean that they are a physician or work a physician's schedule, then you probably have a good idea of the time commitment. An average small animal clinical vet might have a schedule that looks like 4 weekday 10 hour shifts, a rotating weekend schedule that might be one Saturday per month, and likely 3-4 weeks vacation per year. Many vets end up having to spend extra time after their shift end to finish paperwork and do some client callbacks, so on average 40-50 hours per week actually working plus their weekend rotation. \n",

      "And as I said, there's a very wide range depending on what area of vet med you go into. Some people might be ER vets, pulling 12-14 hour shifts for 3 days in row then have like a week off. Some might be specialist surgeons or neurologists, so they have to be on call for emergency surgery which can be very disruptive to routine life but comes with high pay. Some might work industry or government jobs and have a very predictable 9-5, M-F schedule. Some might be full time teleradiologists who work 25 hours total per week, all from home.|There's some imprecision/hand-waving in the description here. 6-12 months is a wide range.

Most of the large global teleradiology companies pay quite well (in the US most full-time teleradiologists will make in the range of $300-600K (USD) annually. I think most of the large global teleradiology companies (Antech, IDEXX, VetCT, etc.) might have a slight differential pay for their radiologists based on cost of living in their country of residence, but I am not totally sure about that. It won't be a big difference, though, because they don't want to discourage radiologists from living in time zones with reduced coverage (most of their radiologists will be in the North American and Western European time zones, so coverage in Asia/Australia tends to be poor).|I don't know any veterinary or human radiologists who are concerned about AI taking our jobs in our lifetime. Perhaps we are all collectively delusional, but I doubt it.

There were two students in my class in their 50s, and several in their 30s and 40s. Really the biggest question is financial. If you’ve made enough money in your career up to now that you can fund the educational path without loans, you are good to go. If you need to take out major loans, then you’ll have to do some number crunching to figure out if you can make it work. Figure you’ll need 2-3 years to complete your academic and veterinary experience prerequisites, then 4 years of school means you’ll be in your mid-40s when you graduate. Tuition for 4 years will be $200-300K (depending on if you get into your in-state school). Most people need to budget another $100-150K for living expenses, but presumably your calculation will be different depending on your personal situation (Own your own home? Have a spouse/partner with a job? Have kids? Etc). \n",

That will be up a bit in 8 years (although tuition and living expenses may also be higher than the figures I listed). Many vets these days have trouble paying off their loans in 20-25 years and may go for an income-based repayment plan (in which the balance of your loans are forgiven after 20 or 25 years). So if at age 40 you are entering vet school in the same financial situation as the typical 22 year old student, you may end up spending your entire career as a vet paying off the loans.|The ones I remember were the Nextel phones.

      "\n",
      ">Commitment Process:  \n",
      "One of the most important aspects of participation in the VIRMP is the early commitment which is made by the applicant; that is, the applicant must agree to accept a position at any of the institutions or private practices which he/she ranked. When creating an account, the applicant will electronically sign an agreement to this effect. Failure to comply will result in sanctions including a ban from participation in the VIRMP for at least 3 years. This agreement must be completed online no later than February 16, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the deadline to withdraw has already passed. The match is not a traditional job offer/acceptance situation. When you signed the electronic commitment, that was your acceptance of whatever \"job offer\" is assigned to you by the match program. You have already accepted any potential job offer from all the internship programs you decided to apply for. You are already past the point of having the option to reject an internship \"offer\" without penalty.|There's no specific timeline after the match. Essentially, at some point in the days/weeks after the match, your internship institution should contact you and provide information regarding starting dates, orientation schedule, state licensing info (if needed), and to request any personal information they need for employment/HR purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are going to reject the internship, out of professional courtesy you should do that ASAP when you get your match result. You will still be penalized by the VIRMP with the 3 year freeze, and you likely will go on a Do Not Hire list at the institution, but you at least give the institution the opportunity to scramble and find a replacement for the internship spot you are vacating. \n",
      "\n",
      "You should probably be aware also that even after the 3 year VIRMP freeze, you would be seriously damaging your chances of ever matching in the future. Vet Med is a surprisingly small world, and many people (especially in academia) are well connected. Your decision to reject an internship after the match will reflect poorly on the faculty who wrote your reference letters, and they will almost certainly not agree to write you another letter if you decide to reapply in the future. Chances are none of your other current faculty would be comfortable writing a letter for you after a 3 year hiatus (especially knowing the reason for the hiatus). So during those three years you would need to establish new positive working relationships, ideally with boarded specialists, who would write your reference letters and directly address your previous actions. Even then, many internship programs would likely view your application with a very big red flag, unless there was an extenuating circumstance like an immediate family member fell ill and you had to pause/upend your career path in order to take care of them.|If you have the time and money to spend on training to be a CVT, it's fine. But don't approach it like a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a vet. It would be like becoming a Registered Nurse as a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a Medical Doctor. Essentially, you should view it as a backup career option, which is not totally unreasonable as the acceptance rate for vet school is like 8-12%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that although there is overlap in knowledge between the two careers, most of the classes you take aren't applicable to vet school pre-reqs (as far as I'm aware). So after you got your CVT, you would then need to go back to school and take all the vet school requirements. Furthermore, it is generally advantageous to have varied animal/industry experience, not just all small animal clinical experience. Do you know how many vet school applicants are small animal clinical vet techs/assistants? Like, almost all of them.

There's the adage of needing 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something, but what's usually lost from that concept is that it's 10,000 hours of \\*\\*guided\\*\\* practice. That is, being supervised by a teacher, trainer, coach, etc. to correct your mistakes and reinforce your successes. Without the guidance, you are very likely just reinforcing your bad habits. I have met many GPs and ER vets with years of experience who \\*think\\* they are good at rads, but in reality are probably worse than an average vet student who just finished their radiology rotation. To take it a step further, even radiologists who are working solo and/or teleradiology exclusive and therefore very rarely getting second opinions on their reads or followup from surgeons and pathologists also end up reinforcing bad habits. Without surgeons and pathologists to keep us honest, we may as well believe we have a 100% accuracy rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the hardest part about learning to read radiographs is being able to differentiate normal from abnormal. This is a lot harder than it sounds, because there is a very wide range of \"normal\" and it overlaps with a lot of \"abnormal.\" And what I mean by normal is \"no clinically significant abnormalities\", which is different from \"textbook normal.\" A prime example of this is abdominal radiographs on a patient with acute vomiting and diarrhea. Most of the time, I read these out as normal abdomen. The intern or ER doc may then come and ask, so these don't look like gastroenteritis? To which I ask, what are the radiographic signs of gastroenteritis? And they don't answer, because of course there aren't really any specific radiographic signs of gastroenteritis. I may see some things that I associate more often with gastroenteritis — fragmented gas pattern in the jejunum, diffuse gas dilation of the GI tract, etc. — and if the clinical history fits I may conclude acute gastroenteritis so the ordering clinician feels better about their workup. But in reality, those radiographic signs are pretty common in animals with no GI symptoms at all, so it wouldn't be wrong to just conclude \"normal abdomen.\" The goal of abdominal rads in the acutely vomiting animal is not to rule \\*\\*in\\*\\* gastroenteritis, it is to rule \\*\\*out\\*\\* mechanical obstruction, radiopaque foreign material, or other gross abnormalities like abdominal mass effect or ascites. \"Normal abdomen\" effectively rules those things out, leaving you with a provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis so long as the remainder of the clinical picture fits (i.e., not in acute renal failure, liver failure, Addisonian crisis, etc.). \n",
      "\n",
      "So ultimately this is where reading textbooks like Thrall is useful, even if the example images aren't amazing. You learn what the actual radiographic signs are that are classically associated with disease processes. There isn't really a better overall textbook out there than Thrall. For thorax specifically though, I like the BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Thoracic Imaging: [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/BSAVA+Manual+of+Canine+and+Feline+Thoracic+Imaging-p-9780905214979](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/bsava+manual+of+canine+and+feline+thoracic+imaging-p-9780905214979) It's a little bit dated (published 2008) but it's not like there have been major advances in thoracic radiography since then.

I've never even owned a dog.|With the understanding that this Reddit post is not a job ad, biggest immediate red flag is “competitive wage.” Everyone says that, I’ve never seen any job ad that declares their salary not to be competitive. There’s a shortage of vets, and we’re inundated with recruiting emails. It’s not uncommon for us to simply delete/ignore any ads that don’t list an actual salary range. For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location. Including production, I would bet it’s not unusual for vets in OR to be making $180-200K. \n",

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices.

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that.

They are generally customized for an individual resident, and the \"alternative\" aspect is usually that the supervising radiologists will be spread out over 2 or more institutions rather than all in one location. There is still a requirement that a residency director be on location at the primary hospital for at least 50% of the time, and at least one other supervising radiologist (but typically more than one) be available for immediate live clinical consultation/interaction the rest of the time (usually meaning the resident goes to a different hospital with a radiologist, or the other radiologist is a contracted locum at the primary hospital, but technically could also be a virtual locum on a Zoom call all day). \n",

There is still a requirement of at least 2 boarded radiologists to establish an alternative track residency, so if you are restricted in not being able to leave your geographic area, there needs to be two radiologists within your radius who agree to take on this task of training you.|What niche branch/specialty are you talking about? It likely varies to some degree from specialty to specialty.\n",

Realistically, in order to lose a case like that, you'd have to have a radiologist willing to testify that your miss was a major error that affected the outcome of the case and that a general practitioner should be expected to identify. Any doctor, radiologist or not, who claims that loss of serosal detail in the right cranial quadrant is a sure sign of pancreatitis that shouldn't be missed is full of shit. As a radiologist, I am well aware of all the classical radiographic signs of pancreatitis, and anecdotally based on followup abdominal ultrasounds in these cases I can confidently say the classical signs of pancreatitis on radiographs are both poorly sensitive and poorly specific. I am generally actually hesitant to even teach people the radiographic signs, because it probably just means more vets will be misdiagnosing pancreatitis.\n",

That's, like, relatively high. So chances are non-radiologists would have a significantly higher rate of major errors. I still wouldn't be overly concerned about being sued, as your error would have to be pretty egregious for a radiologist to testify that you should be penalized for it, but as a matter of basic medical standard and patient care you should maybe be concerned.

Cost of further diagnostics is certainly a consideration for our clients compared to human med, but if you had a complaint of vomiting and abdominal pain and went to the ER, and their initial imaging screening was inconclusive, I would bet you wouldn't seriously consider letting them do a diagnostic laparotomy on you in lieu of further imaging.

      "\n",
      "1. Applicants who have years of experience in lieu of a rotating internship are generally at a disadvantage. The key is what the nature of your experience is. If you're working for 3 years as an ER vet in a referral hospital with all the standard specialties that one would have at a rotating internship, that is good experience. If you're working for 2 years in a general practice with minimal to no direct exposure to (boarded) specialists, that's bad experience. \n",
      "2. An internship recognized by EBVS is *probably* valid, but I would guess it is viewed as second tier unless it is well enough known as to be internationally reputable.\n",
      "3. Recs from vets in the UK would hold weight, so long as the vets are boarded specialists. DACVS probably holds more weight than DECVS, but only by a little.\n",
      "4. I have no idea how you would get involved in publishing something at a private clinic. It really just depends on whether you have contact with a boarded specialist who is willing to co-author the paper with you.\n",
      "5. The surgery diploma may help a little bit, but not much. Any ACVS residency is likely to be quite skeptical of the diploma/certificate, since they don't really know how rigorous the criteria are for passing. It would likely simply be viewed as \"candidate demonstrates an interest in small animal surgery.\"\n",
      "6. GPA comparison is very challenging unless the residency happens to have a faculty surgeon who is familiar with your school. If a class rank is available and can be shared as part of your application, that may hold more weight than straight GPA.\n",
      "7. They won't skip over your application without ECFVG/NAVLE, but you are likely at some kind of disadvantage without it. Also note that without ECFVG/NAVLE, even if you pass your boards you would be restricted to working at a university teaching hospital in the US.\n",
      "8. The most important part of the residency application is your references. Ideally, if you can find a surgeon (or two) who are double boarded in ACVS and ECVS to write letters, that's the best thing you can do. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the thing that residencies want to know is whether you will pass your boards and whether you will be a functional part of a surgery department for the 3 years of residency. The best way for them to know this is by having references from DACVS vets who know the candidate well and can vouch for their ability to survive a residency. This is the reason why DACVS references are preferred – they have been through the residency and passed the ACVS boards. DECVS may be perfectly knowledgeable and skilled surgeons, but they have not gone through an ACVS residency and passed those boards. There is an assumption that the two are probably close enough that a DECVS can evaluate whether a candidate is residency material, but again, if you have no DACVS references you are likely at a disadvantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the internship vs experience and the utility of the 1 year surgery diploma/certificate, ultimately the problem is that this is \"nontraditional\" for a candidate for an ACVS residency. There are many, many qualified applicants with a more traditional education/training background, many more than the number of residency spots. Last year, there were 238 applicants for 54 spots, with a match rate of 22.27%. More than 4 applicants for every 1 spot. And the vast majority of those applicants went to an AVMA-Accredited school, did a rotating internship in the US or Canada, and the vast majority of successful applicants also have one or more surgical internships as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "ACVS residencies have decided that this background – good grades at accredited school, rotating internship, surgical internship, multiple good DACVS references – is a good predictor of success for a resident. And there are more applicants who fit this profile than there are residency spots. So for you to supplant one of those candidates as a Spanish vet school grad, with no rotating internship, no surgical internship, and no DACVS references, you basically have to be a total rock star of a surgery candidate, and your DECVS references will need to say so emphatically.|\"Recognized\" is a nebulous word. Because vet med is minimally regulated in the US, anybody can do anything once they have a license. There are plenty of self-styled orthopedic \"specialists\" who have never been through a residency and are certainly not board-certified surgeons. But are boarded European specialists generally considered equivalent to the American specialist counterparts? Yes. At least in radiology, for example, a DECVDI is counted as a DACVR equivalent for the purpose of ACVR residency accreditation. Mind you, we are talking about boarded specialists here, not the Advanced Practitioner certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "To work as a vet in the US, you either have to have passed your NAVLE, or you have to work under the umbrella license of a university teaching hospital. This applies to boarded specialists as well. Having a DECVS or DECVDI does not allow you to bypass the need for a valid medical license. So if you are a DECVS who has not passed the NAVLE (either directly or after having gone through ECFVG or PAVE certification first), your only option is to work at a university.

Most people these days are looking to work in a larger team environment, as opposed to being effectively a solo practitioner.

So if we assume 10% interest rate (which is higher than it is right now, I think), over 7 years you accrue $106k on a $270k loan, bringing you up to $376k when you finish in the US. On a $400k loan over 5 years at 10%, you accrue $109k in interest, putting you at $509k when you finish in the UK. That's a difference of $133k.

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that.

It depends of course on what branch of vet med you go into, and to some degree your own job selection (some people are just workaholics), but if when you say \"one of my parents works in human medicine\" you mean that they are a physician or work a physician's schedule, then you probably have a good idea of the time commitment. An average small animal clinical vet might have a schedule that looks like 4 weekday 10 hour shifts, a rotating weekend schedule that might be one Saturday per month, and likely 3-4 weeks vacation per year. Many vets end up having to spend extra time after their shift end to finish paperwork and do some client callbacks, so on average 40-50 hours per week actually working plus their weekend rotation. \n",

If you need to take out major loans, then you’ll have to do some number crunching to figure out if you can make it work. Figure you’ll need 2-3 years to complete your academic and veterinary experience prerequisites, then 4 years of school means you’ll be in your mid-40s when you graduate. Tuition for 4 years will be $200-300K (depending on if you get into your in-state school). Most people need to budget another $100-150K for living expenses, but presumably your calculation will be different depending on your personal situation (Own your own home?

Many vets these days have trouble paying off their loans in 20-25 years and may go for an income-based repayment plan (in which the balance of your loans are forgiven after 20 or 25 years).

      "\n",
      ">Commitment Process:  \n",
      "One of the most important aspects of participation in the VIRMP is the early commitment which is made by the applicant; that is, the applicant must agree to accept a position at any of the institutions or private practices which he/she ranked. When creating an account, the applicant will electronically sign an agreement to this effect. Failure to comply will result in sanctions including a ban from participation in the VIRMP for at least 3 years. This agreement must be completed online no later than February 16, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the deadline to withdraw has already passed. The match is not a traditional job offer/acceptance situation. When you signed the electronic commitment, that was your acceptance of whatever \"job offer\" is assigned to you by the match program. You have already accepted any potential job offer from all the internship programs you decided to apply for. You are already past the point of having the option to reject an internship \"offer\" without penalty.|There's no specific timeline after the match. Essentially, at some point in the days/weeks after the match, your internship institution should contact you and provide information regarding starting dates, orientation schedule, state licensing info (if needed), and to request any personal information they need for employment/HR purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are going to reject the internship, out of professional courtesy you should do that ASAP when you get your match result. You will still be penalized by the VIRMP with the 3 year freeze, and you likely will go on a Do Not Hire list at the institution, but you at least give the institution the opportunity to scramble and find a replacement for the internship spot you are vacating. \n",
      "\n",
      "You should probably be aware also that even after the 3 year VIRMP freeze, you would be seriously damaging your chances of ever matching in the future. Vet Med is a surprisingly small world, and many people (especially in academia) are well connected. Your decision to reject an internship after the match will reflect poorly on the faculty who wrote your reference letters, and they will almost certainly not agree to write you another letter if you decide to reapply in the future. Chances are none of your other current faculty would be comfortable writing a letter for you after a 3 year hiatus (especially knowing the reason for the hiatus). So during those three years you would need to establish new positive working relationships, ideally with boarded specialists, who would write your reference letters and directly address your previous actions. Even then, many internship programs would likely view your application with a very big red flag, unless there was an extenuating circumstance like an immediate family member fell ill and you had to pause/upend your career path in order to take care of them.|If you have the time and money to spend on training to be a CVT, it's fine. But don't approach it like a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a vet. It would be like becoming a Registered Nurse as a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a Medical Doctor.

      "\n",
      "The problem is that although there is overlap in knowledge between the two careers, most of the classes you take aren't applicable to vet school pre-reqs (as far as I'm aware).

Furthermore, it is generally advantageous to have varied animal/industry experience, not just all small animal clinical experience. Do you know how many vet school applicants are small animal clinical vet techs/assistants? Like, almost all of them.

To take it a step further, even radiologists who are working solo and/or teleradiology exclusive and therefore very rarely getting second opinions on their reads or followup from surgeons and pathologists also end up reinforcing bad habits. Without surgeons and pathologists to keep us honest, we may as well believe we have a 100% accuracy rate.\n",

      "To me, the hardest part about learning to read radiographs is being able to differentiate normal from abnormal. This is a lot harder than it sounds, because there is a very wide range of \"normal\" and it overlaps with a lot of \"abnormal.\" And what I mean by normal is \"no clinically significant abnormalities\", which is different from \"textbook normal.\" A prime example of this is abdominal radiographs on a patient with acute vomiting and diarrhea. Most of the time, I read these out as normal abdomen. The intern or ER doc may then come and ask, so these don't look like gastroenteritis? To which I ask, what are the radiographic signs of gastroenteritis? And they don't answer, because of course there aren't really any specific radiographic signs of gastroenteritis. I may see some things that I associate more often with gastroenteritis — fragmented gas pattern in the jejunum, diffuse gas dilation of the GI tract, etc. — and if the clinical history fits I may conclude acute gastroenteritis so the ordering clinician feels better about their workup. But in reality, those radiographic signs are pretty common in animals with no GI symptoms at all, so it wouldn't be wrong to just conclude \"normal abdomen.\" The goal of abdominal rads in the acutely vomiting animal is not to rule \\*\\*in\\*\\* gastroenteritis, it is to rule \\*\\*out\\*\\* mechanical obstruction, radiopaque foreign material, or other gross abnormalities like abdominal mass effect or ascites. \"Normal abdomen\" effectively rules those things out, leaving you with a provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis so long as the remainder of the clinical picture fits (i.e., not in acute renal failure, liver failure, Addisonian crisis, etc.). \n",
      "\n",
      "So ultimately this is where reading textbooks like Thrall is useful, even if the example images aren't amazing. You learn what the actual radiographic signs are that are classically associated with disease processes. There isn't really a better overall textbook out there than Thrall. For thorax specifically though, I like the BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Thoracic Imaging: [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/BSAVA+Manual+of+Canine+and+Feline+Thoracic+Imaging-p-9780905214979](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/bsava+manual+of+canine+and+feline+thoracic+imaging-p-9780905214979) It's a little bit dated (published 2008) but it's not like there have been major advances in thoracic radiography since then. The BSAVA abdomen and MSK books are decent, but not as good as the thorax one.\n",

I've never even owned a dog.|With the understanding that this Reddit post is not a job ad, biggest immediate red flag is “competitive wage.” Everyone says that, I’ve never seen any job ad that declares their salary not to be competitive. There’s a shortage of vets, and we’re inundated with recruiting emails. It’s not uncommon for us to simply delete/ignore any ads that don’t list an actual salary range. For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location. Including production, I would bet it’s not unusual for vets in OR to be making $180-200K. \n",

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",

      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices.

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you.

They are generally customized for an individual resident, and the \"alternative\" aspect is usually that the supervising radiologists will be spread out over 2 or more institutions rather than all in one location. There is still a requirement that a residency director be on location at the primary hospital for at least 50% of the time, and at least one other supervising radiologist (but typically more than one) be available for immediate live clinical consultation/interaction the rest of the time (usually meaning the resident goes to a different hospital with a radiologist, or the other radiologist is a contracted locum at the primary hospital, but technically could also be a virtual locum on a Zoom call all day). \n",

There is still a requirement of at least 2 boarded radiologists to establish an alternative track residency, so if you are restricted in not being able to leave your geographic area, there needs to be two radiologists within your radius who agree to take on this task of training you.|What niche branch/specialty are you talking about?

Realistically, in order to lose a case like that, you'd have to have a radiologist willing to testify that your miss was a major error that affected the outcome of the case and that a general practitioner should be expected to identify. Any doctor, radiologist or not, who claims that loss of serosal detail in the right cranial quadrant is a sure sign of pancreatitis that shouldn't be missed is full of shit. As a radiologist, I am well aware of all the classical radiographic signs of pancreatitis, and anecdotally based on followup abdominal ultrasounds in these cases I can confidently say the classical signs of pancreatitis on radiographs are both poorly sensitive and poorly specific.

I still wouldn't be overly concerned about being sued, as your error would have to be pretty egregious for a radiologist to testify that you should be penalized for it, but as a matter of basic medical standard and patient care you should maybe be concerned.

      "\n",
      "1. Applicants who have years of experience in lieu of a rotating internship are generally at a disadvantage. The key is what the nature of your experience is. If you're working for 3 years as an ER vet in a referral hospital with all the standard specialties that one would have at a rotating internship, that is good experience. If you're working for 2 years in a general practice with minimal to no direct exposure to (boarded) specialists, that's bad experience. \n",
      "2. An internship recognized by EBVS is *probably* valid, but I would guess it is viewed as second tier unless it is well enough known as to be internationally reputable.\n",
      "3. Recs from vets in the UK would hold weight, so long as the vets are boarded specialists. DACVS probably holds more weight than DECVS, but only by a little.\n",
      "4. I have no idea how you would get involved in publishing something at a private clinic. It really just depends on whether you have contact with a boarded specialist who is willing to co-author the paper with you.\n",
      "5. The surgery diploma may help a little bit, but not much. Any ACVS residency is likely to be quite skeptical of the diploma/certificate, since they don't really know how rigorous the criteria are for passing. It would likely simply be viewed as \"candidate demonstrates an interest in small animal surgery.\"\n",
      "6. GPA comparison is very challenging unless the residency happens to have a faculty surgeon who is familiar with your school. If a class rank is available and can be shared as part of your application, that may hold more weight than straight GPA.\n",
      "7. They won't skip over your application without ECFVG/NAVLE, but you are likely at some kind of disadvantage without it. Also note that without ECFVG/NAVLE, even if you pass your boards you would be restricted to working at a university teaching hospital in the US.\n",
      "8. The most important part of the residency application is your references. Ideally, if you can find a surgeon (or two) who are double boarded in ACVS and ECVS to write letters, that's the best thing you can do. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the thing that residencies want to know is whether you will pass your boards and whether you will be a functional part of a surgery department for the 3 years of residency. The best way for them to know this is by having references from DACVS vets who know the candidate well and can vouch for their ability to survive a residency. This is the reason why DACVS references are preferred – they have been through the residency and passed the ACVS boards. DECVS may be perfectly knowledgeable and skilled surgeons, but they have not gone through an ACVS residency and passed those boards. There is an assumption that the two are probably close enough that a DECVS can evaluate whether a candidate is residency material, but again, if you have no DACVS references you are likely at a disadvantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the internship vs experience and the utility of the 1 year surgery diploma/certificate, ultimately the problem is that this is \"nontraditional\" for a candidate for an ACVS residency. There are many, many qualified applicants with a more traditional education/training background, many more than the number of residency spots. Last year, there were 238 applicants for 54 spots, with a match rate of 22.27%. More than 4 applicants for every 1 spot. And the vast majority of those applicants went to an AVMA-Accredited school, did a rotating internship in the US or Canada, and the vast majority of successful applicants also have one or more surgical internships as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "ACVS residencies have decided that this background – good grades at accredited school, rotating internship, surgical internship, multiple good DACVS references – is a good predictor of success for a resident. And there are more applicants who fit this profile than there are residency spots. So for you to supplant one of those candidates as a Spanish vet school grad, with no rotating internship, no surgical internship, and no DACVS references, you basically have to be a total rock star of a surgery candidate, and your DECVS references will need to say so emphatically.|\"Recognized\" is a nebulous word. Because vet med is minimally regulated in the US, anybody can do anything once they have a license.

But are boarded European specialists generally considered equivalent to the American specialist counterparts? Yes. At least in radiology, for example, a DECVDI is counted as a DACVR equivalent for the purpose of ACVR residency accreditation. Mind you, we are talking about boarded specialists here, not the Advanced Practitioner certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "To work as a vet in the US, you either have to have passed your NAVLE, or you have to work under the umbrella license of a university teaching hospital. This applies to boarded specialists as well. Having a DECVS or DECVDI does not allow you to bypass the need for a valid medical license. So if you are a DECVS who has not passed the NAVLE (either directly or after having gone through ECFVG or PAVE certification first), your only option is to work at a university. That said, there are many such European specialists working at universities, because academia pays like crap so it's hard to attract and retain faculty. \n",

      "Beyond that, though, what is the clinic organization and working conditions? 20% ownership at signing and \"can change the name to whatever they want\" suggests this new employee has immediate full control of the practice itself. To me this sounds like there's one vet who owns the clinic is looking to retire, allowing the new vet to rename/rebrand however they like. Most people these days are looking to work in a larger team environment, as opposed to being effectively a solo practitioner. This also begs the question of how many support staff are there for the X number of vets? Especially how many RVTs, how many VAs, how many kennel attendants, how many receptionists, and is there a practice manager?|There are no reliable data, that I'm aware of. And salaries across the board in vet med have changed drastically since the pandemic, so any data you find from 2020 or earlier is likely so outdated as to be totally useless at this point.

I would guess the average cardiologist makes around $350K, and I personally know cardiologists making over $400K, which is probably mid-upper range for private practice.

Veterinary radiology tech backgrounds run the gamut: vet assistants who are trained on-the-job to acquire imaging studies, registered vet techs (RVT) who are trained on-the-job and who may progress to vet tech specialization (VTS, involves benchmarks for experience and then passing a certifying exam), human medical radiologic technologists (RT) who shift to vet med part time or full time, human medical registered diagnostic medical sonographers (RDMS) who shift to vet med part time or full time. \n",

I graduated from college in the late 90s, had several family members who were MDs including my father and a couple of my older cousins. So I kind of knew where medicine was headed, and I also really disliked the pre-med students in college, and didn't want to spend my life calling them my colleagues. One of my friends was pre-vet, and she was pretty cool, so I switched sides (took a couple years off after college to pursue other random things but eventually settled on vet school).|Starting salary for a small animal private practice GP is about $130k right now, so the simple math says yes, the two additional years of working salary is worth the higher tuition.|That starts getting complicated. So if we assume 10% interest rate (which is higher than it is right now, I think), over 7 years you accrue $106k on a $270k loan, bringing you up to $376k when you finish in the US. On a $400k loan over 5 years at 10%, you accrue $109k in interest, putting you at $509k when you finish in the UK. That's a difference of $133k. In order for you to bridge that gap in the two years of working, you'd need to put in somewhere around $6k per month towards your loans.\n",

      "There's a lot of variables, though, which can result in a significant change in the calculation. Obviously, the real cost of attendance is a big one, so if real cost of attendance in the UK is lower than you estimate, or the cost in the US is higher than you estimate, that will be a big change. Also whatever is that actual interest rate you get will make a big difference.

For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location.

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that. I don't know the pathology dept at NCSU specifically, but most pathology depts are usually pretty welcoming to any students who show real interest in pathology.|You need to put actual numbers in your job ads as a bare minimum to get any interest.

And that's for a new graduate, so if you're serious about \"commensurate with experience\" then it should be higher than that for an experienced vet.|That is not unusual in the highest cost of living areas like Daly City (Bay Area) or NYC. In the same way that people in the lowest cost of living parts of the country like Oklahoma are getting offers with base salary in the $70-80K range which is 30% below average (despite cost of living only being 13% lower than national average). Veterinarians devaluing ourselves is definitely part of the problem that perpetuates our low pay relative other equivalently trained healthcare professionals.|Yes, most vets have free time, families, pets, and a life outside of work. It depends of course on what branch of vet med you go into, and to some degree your own job selection (some people are just workaholics), but if when you say \"one of my parents works in human medicine\" you mean that they are a physician or work a physician's schedule, then you probably have a good idea of the time commitment. An average small animal clinical vet might have a schedule that looks like 4 weekday 10 hour shifts, a rotating weekend schedule that might be one Saturday per month, and likely 3-4 weeks vacation per year. Many vets end up having to spend extra time after their shift end to finish paperwork and do some client callbacks, so on average 40-50 hours per week actually working plus their weekend rotation. \n",

      "And as I said, there's a very wide range depending on what area of vet med you go into. Some people might be ER vets, pulling 12-14 hour shifts for 3 days in row then have like a week off. Some might be specialist surgeons or neurologists, so they have to be on call for emergency surgery which can be very disruptive to routine life but comes with high pay. Some might work industry or government jobs and have a very predictable 9-5, M-F schedule.

Most of the large global teleradiology companies pay quite well (in the US most full-time teleradiologists will make in the range of $300-600K (USD) annually. I think most of the large global teleradiology companies (Antech, IDEXX, VetCT, etc.) might have a slight differential pay for their radiologists based on cost of living in their country of residence, but I am not totally sure about that. It won't be a big difference, though, because they don't want to discourage radiologists from living in time zones with reduced coverage (most of their radiologists will be in the North American and Western European time zones, so coverage in Asia/Australia tends to be poor).|I don't know any veterinary or human radiologists who are concerned about AI taking our jobs in our lifetime. Perhaps we are all collectively delusional, but I doubt it.

There were two students in my class in their 50s, and several in their 30s and 40s. Really the biggest question is financial. If you’ve made enough money in your career up to now that you can fund the educational path without loans, you are good to go. If you need to take out major loans, then you’ll have to do some number crunching to figure out if you can make it work. Figure you’ll need 2-3 years to complete your academic and veterinary experience prerequisites, then 4 years of school means you’ll be in your mid-40s when you graduate. Tuition for 4 years will be $200-300K (depending on if you get into your in-state school). Most people need to budget another $100-150K for living expenses, but presumably your calculation will be different depending on your personal situation (Own your own home?

That will be up a bit in 8 years (although tuition and living expenses may also be higher than the figures I listed). Many vets these days have trouble paying off their loans in 20-25 years and may go for an income-based repayment plan (in which the balance of your loans are forgiven after 20 or 25 years). So if at age 40 you are entering vet school in the same financial situation as the typical 22 year old student, you may end up spending your entire career as a vet paying off the loans.|The ones I remember were the Nextel phones.

      "One of the most important aspects of participation in the VIRMP is the early commitment which is made by the applicant; that is, the applicant must agree to accept a position at any of the institutions or private practices which he/she ranked. When creating an account, the applicant will electronically sign an agreement to this effect. Failure to comply will result in sanctions including a ban from participation in the VIRMP for at least 3 years. This agreement must be completed online no later than February 16, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the deadline to withdraw has already passed. The match is not a traditional job offer/acceptance situation. When you signed the electronic commitment, that was your acceptance of whatever \"job offer\" is assigned to you by the match program. You have already accepted any potential job offer from all the internship programs you decided to apply for. You are already past the point of having the option to reject an internship \"offer\" without penalty.|There's no specific timeline after the match. Essentially, at some point in the days/weeks after the match, your internship institution should contact you and provide information regarding starting dates, orientation schedule, state licensing info (if needed), and to request any personal information they need for employment/HR purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are going to reject the internship, out of professional courtesy you should do that ASAP when you get your match result. You will still be penalized by the VIRMP with the 3 year freeze, and you likely will go on a Do Not Hire list at the institution, but you at least give the institution the opportunity to scramble and find a replacement for the internship spot you are vacating. \n",
      "\n",
      "You should probably be aware also that even after the 3 year VIRMP freeze, you would be seriously damaging your chances of ever matching in the future. Vet Med is a surprisingly small world, and many people (especially in academia) are well connected. Your decision to reject an internship after the match will reflect poorly on the faculty who wrote your reference letters, and they will almost certainly not agree to write you another letter if you decide to reapply in the future. Chances are none of your other current faculty would be comfortable writing a letter for you after a 3 year hiatus (especially knowing the reason for the hiatus). So during those three years you would need to establish new positive working relationships, ideally with boarded specialists, who would write your reference letters and directly address your previous actions. Even then, many internship programs would likely view your application with a very big red flag, unless there was an extenuating circumstance like an immediate family member fell ill and you had to pause/upend your career path in order to take care of them.|If you have the time and money to spend on training to be a CVT, it's fine.

But if you're pretty focused/set on getting into vet school, there's better ways to spend your time and money to maximize your chances of getting in.|You probably won't like this answer, but it is quite difficult to become great at radiographs without active guidance. There's the adage of needing 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something, but what's usually lost from that concept is that it's 10,000 hours of \\*\\*guided\\*\\* practice. That is, being supervised by a teacher, trainer, coach, etc. to correct your mistakes and reinforce your successes. Without the guidance, you are very likely just reinforcing your bad habits. I have met many GPs and ER vets with years of experience who \\*think\\* they are good at rads, but in reality are probably worse than an average vet student who just finished their radiology rotation. To take it a step further, even radiologists who are working solo and/or teleradiology exclusive and therefore very rarely getting second opinions on their reads or followup from surgeons and pathologists also end up reinforcing bad habits. Without surgeons and pathologists to keep us honest, we may as well believe we have a 100% accuracy rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the hardest part about learning to read radiographs is being able to differentiate normal from abnormal. This is a lot harder than it sounds, because there is a very wide range of \"normal\" and it overlaps with a lot of \"abnormal.\" And what I mean by normal is \"no clinically significant abnormalities\", which is different from \"textbook normal.\" A prime example of this is abdominal radiographs on a patient with acute vomiting and diarrhea. Most of the time, I read these out as normal abdomen. The intern or ER doc may then come and ask, so these don't look like gastroenteritis? To which I ask, what are the radiographic signs of gastroenteritis? And they don't answer, because of course there aren't really any specific radiographic signs of gastroenteritis. I may see some things that I associate more often with gastroenteritis — fragmented gas pattern in the jejunum, diffuse gas dilation of the GI tract, etc. — and if the clinical history fits I may conclude acute gastroenteritis so the ordering clinician feels better about their workup. But in reality, those radiographic signs are pretty common in animals with no GI symptoms at all, so it wouldn't be wrong to just conclude \"normal abdomen.\" The goal of abdominal rads in the acutely vomiting animal is not to rule \\*\\*in\\*\\* gastroenteritis, it is to rule \\*\\*out\\*\\* mechanical obstruction, radiopaque foreign material, or other gross abnormalities like abdominal mass effect or ascites. \"Normal abdomen\" effectively rules those things out, leaving you with a provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis so long as the remainder of the clinical picture fits (i.e., not in acute renal failure, liver failure, Addisonian crisis, etc.). \n",
      "\n",
      "So ultimately this is where reading textbooks like Thrall is useful, even if the example images aren't amazing. You learn what the actual radiographic signs are that are classically associated with disease processes. There isn't really a better overall textbook out there than Thrall. For thorax specifically though, I like the BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Thoracic Imaging: [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/BSAVA+Manual+of+Canine+and+Feline+Thoracic+Imaging-p-9780905214979](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/bsava+manual+of+canine+and+feline+thoracic+imaging-p-9780905214979) It's a little bit dated (published 2008) but it's not like there have been major advances in thoracic radiography since then. The BSAVA abdomen and MSK books are decent, but not as good as the thorax one.\n",

I've never even owned a dog.|With the understanding that this Reddit post is not a job ad, biggest immediate red flag is “competitive wage.” Everyone says that, I’ve never seen any job ad that declares their salary not to be competitive. There’s a shortage of vets, and we’re inundated with recruiting emails. It’s not uncommon for us to simply delete/ignore any ads that don’t list an actual salary range. For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location. Including production, I would bet it’s not unusual for vets in OR to be making $180-200K. \n",

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations. A good nonprofit has to be run like a normal for-profit hospital, and then there has to be great fundraising and establishment of trust and engagement with the community. Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you.

They are generally customized for an individual resident, and the \"alternative\" aspect is usually that the supervising radiologists will be spread out over 2 or more institutions rather than all in one location. There is still a requirement that a residency director be on location at the primary hospital for at least 50% of the time, and at least one other supervising radiologist (but typically more than one) be available for immediate live clinical consultation/interaction the rest of the time (usually meaning the resident goes to a different hospital with a radiologist, or the other radiologist is a contracted locum at the primary hospital, but technically could also be a virtual locum on a Zoom call all day). \n",

There is still a requirement of at least 2 boarded radiologists to establish an alternative track residency, so if you are restricted in not being able to leave your geographic area, there needs to be two radiologists within your radius who agree to take on this task of training you.|What niche branch/specialty are you talking about?

Realistically, in order to lose a case like that, you'd have to have a radiologist willing to testify that your miss was a major error that affected the outcome of the case and that a general practitioner should be expected to identify. Any doctor, radiologist or not, who claims that loss of serosal detail in the right cranial quadrant is a sure sign of pancreatitis that shouldn't be missed is full of shit. As a radiologist, I am well aware of all the classical radiographic signs of pancreatitis, and anecdotally based on followup abdominal ultrasounds in these cases I can confidently say the classical signs of pancreatitis on radiographs are both poorly sensitive and poorly specific.

I still wouldn't be overly concerned about being sued, as your error would have to be pretty egregious for a radiologist to testify that you should be penalized for it, but as a matter of basic medical standard and patient care you should maybe be concerned.

      "\n",
      "1. Applicants who have years of experience in lieu of a rotating internship are generally at a disadvantage. The key is what the nature of your experience is. If you're working for 3 years as an ER vet in a referral hospital with all the standard specialties that one would have at a rotating internship, that is good experience. If you're working for 2 years in a general practice with minimal to no direct exposure to (boarded) specialists, that's bad experience. \n",
      "2. An internship recognized by EBVS is *probably* valid, but I would guess it is viewed as second tier unless it is well enough known as to be internationally reputable.\n",
      "3. Recs from vets in the UK would hold weight, so long as the vets are boarded specialists. DACVS probably holds more weight than DECVS, but only by a little.\n",
      "4. I have no idea how you would get involved in publishing something at a private clinic. It really just depends on whether you have contact with a boarded specialist who is willing to co-author the paper with you.\n",
      "5. The surgery diploma may help a little bit, but not much. Any ACVS residency is likely to be quite skeptical of the diploma/certificate, since they don't really know how rigorous the criteria are for passing. It would likely simply be viewed as \"candidate demonstrates an interest in small animal surgery.\"\n",
      "6. GPA comparison is very challenging unless the residency happens to have a faculty surgeon who is familiar with your school. If a class rank is available and can be shared as part of your application, that may hold more weight than straight GPA.\n",
      "7. They won't skip over your application without ECFVG/NAVLE, but you are likely at some kind of disadvantage without it. Also note that without ECFVG/NAVLE, even if you pass your boards you would be restricted to working at a university teaching hospital in the US.\n",
      "8. The most important part of the residency application is your references. Ideally, if you can find a surgeon (or two) who are double boarded in ACVS and ECVS to write letters, that's the best thing you can do. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the thing that residencies want to know is whether you will pass your boards and whether you will be a functional part of a surgery department for the 3 years of residency. The best way for them to know this is by having references from DACVS vets who know the candidate well and can vouch for their ability to survive a residency. This is the reason why DACVS references are preferred – they have been through the residency and passed the ACVS boards. DECVS may be perfectly knowledgeable and skilled surgeons, but they have not gone through an ACVS residency and passed those boards. There is an assumption that the two are probably close enough that a DECVS can evaluate whether a candidate is residency material, but again, if you have no DACVS references you are likely at a disadvantage. \n",

      "Regarding the internship vs experience and the utility of the 1 year surgery diploma/certificate, ultimately the problem is that this is \"nontraditional\" for a candidate for an ACVS residency.

      "ACVS residencies have decided that this background – good grades at accredited school, rotating internship, surgical internship, multiple good DACVS references – is a good predictor of success for a resident. And there are more applicants who fit this profile than there are residency spots. So for you to supplant one of those candidates as a Spanish vet school grad, with no rotating internship, no surgical internship, and no DACVS references, you basically have to be a total rock star of a surgery candidate, and your DECVS references will need to say so emphatically.|\"Recognized\" is a nebulous word. Because vet med is minimally regulated in the US, anybody can do anything once they have a license. There are plenty of self-styled orthopedic \"specialists\" who have never been through a residency and are certainly not board-certified surgeons. But are boarded European specialists generally considered equivalent to the American specialist counterparts? Yes. At least in radiology, for example, a DECVDI is counted as a DACVR equivalent for the purpose of ACVR residency accreditation. Mind you, we are talking about boarded specialists here, not the Advanced Practitioner certificates.\n",

      "To work as a vet in the US, you either have to have passed your NAVLE, or you have to work under the umbrella license of a university teaching hospital. This applies to boarded specialists as well. Having a DECVS or DECVDI does not allow you to bypass the need for a valid medical license. So if you are a DECVS who has not passed the NAVLE (either directly or after having gone through ECFVG or PAVE certification first), your only option is to work at a university. That said, there are many such European specialists working at universities, because academia pays like crap so it's hard to attract and retain faculty. \n",

      "Beyond that, though, what is the clinic organization and working conditions? 20% ownership at signing and \"can change the name to whatever they want\" suggests this new employee has immediate full control of the practice itself. To me this sounds like there's one vet who owns the clinic is looking to retire, allowing the new vet to rename/rebrand however they like. Most people these days are looking to work in a larger team environment, as opposed to being effectively a solo practitioner. This also begs the question of how many support staff are there for the X number of vets? Especially how many RVTs, how many VAs, how many kennel attendants, how many receptionists, and is there a practice manager?|There are no reliable data, that I'm aware of. And salaries across the board in vet med have changed drastically since the pandemic, so any data you find from 2020 or earlier is likely so outdated as to be totally useless at this point.

As a basic rule of thumb, simply by being in a major clinical specialty, you probably will be making $250K at bare minimum. I would guess the average cardiologist makes around $350K, and I personally know cardiologists making over $400K, which is probably mid-upper range for private practice.

And then ideally wherever you do an internship there will also be many additional specialists.|Yes, basically any larger referral hospital or teaching hospital with a radiology department (i.e., has radiologists on staff) will have full time techs working in the radiology department. Veterinary radiology tech backgrounds run the gamut: vet assistants who are trained on-the-job to acquire imaging studies, registered vet techs (RVT) who are trained on-the-job and who may progress to vet tech specialization (VTS, involves benchmarks for experience and then passing a certifying exam), human medical radiologic technologists (RT) who shift to vet med part time or full time, human medical registered diagnostic medical sonographers (RDMS) who shift to vet med part time or full time. \n",

I graduated from college in the late 90s, had several family members who were MDs including my father and a couple of my older cousins. So I kind of knew where medicine was headed, and I also really disliked the pre-med students in college, and didn't want to spend my life calling them my colleagues. One of my friends was pre-vet, and she was pretty cool, so I switched sides (took a couple years off after college to pursue other random things but eventually settled on vet school).|Starting salary for a small animal private practice GP is about $130k right now, so the simple math says yes, the two additional years of working salary is worth the higher tuition.|That starts getting complicated. So if we assume 10% interest rate (which is higher than it is right now, I think), over 7 years you accrue $106k on a $270k loan, bringing you up to $376k when you finish in the US. On a $400k loan over 5 years at 10%, you accrue $109k in interest, putting you at $509k when you finish in the UK. That's a difference of $133k. In order for you to bridge that gap in the two years of working, you'd need to put in somewhere around $6k per month towards your loans.\n",

      "There's a lot of variables, though, which can result in a significant change in the calculation. Obviously, the real cost of attendance is a big one, so if real cost of attendance in the UK is lower than you estimate, or the cost in the US is higher than you estimate, that will be a big change. Also whatever is that actual interest rate you get will make a big difference.

For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location.

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that. I don't know the pathology dept at NCSU specifically, but most pathology depts are usually pretty welcoming to any students who show real interest in pathology.|You need to put actual numbers in your job ads as a bare minimum to get any interest.

And that's for a new graduate, so if you're serious about \"commensurate with experience\" then it should be higher than that for an experienced vet.|That is not unusual in the highest cost of living areas like Daly City (Bay Area) or NYC. In the same way that people in the lowest cost of living parts of the country like Oklahoma are getting offers with base salary in the $70-80K range which is 30% below average (despite cost of living only being 13% lower than national average). Veterinarians devaluing ourselves is definitely part of the problem that perpetuates our low pay relative other equivalently trained healthcare professionals.|Yes, most vets have free time, families, pets, and a life outside of work. It depends of course on what branch of vet med you go into, and to some degree your own job selection (some people are just workaholics), but if when you say \"one of my parents works in human medicine\" you mean that they are a physician or work a physician's schedule, then you probably have a good idea of the time commitment. An average small animal clinical vet might have a schedule that looks like 4 weekday 10 hour shifts, a rotating weekend schedule that might be one Saturday per month, and likely 3-4 weeks vacation per year. Many vets end up having to spend extra time after their shift end to finish paperwork and do some client callbacks, so on average 40-50 hours per week actually working plus their weekend rotation. \n",
      "\n",
      "And as I said, there's a very wide range depending on what area of vet med you go into. Some people might be ER vets, pulling 12-14 hour shifts for 3 days in row then have like a week off. Some might be specialist surgeons or neurologists, so they have to be on call for emergency surgery which can be very disruptive to routine life but comes with high pay. Some might work industry or government jobs and have a very predictable 9-5, M-F schedule. Some might be full time teleradiologists who work 25 hours total per week, all from home.|There's some imprecision/hand-waving in the description here. 6-12 months is a wide range. If you make 80k in 6 months, that's 160k for a year which is higher than the average vet salary in the US right now. 80k in 12 months would be more like the bottom of the range for a new grad in small animal private practice.

Most of the large global teleradiology companies pay quite well (in the US most full-time teleradiologists will make in the range of $300-600K (USD) annually. I think most of the large global teleradiology companies (Antech, IDEXX, VetCT, etc.) might have a slight differential pay for their radiologists based on cost of living in their country of residence, but I am not totally sure about that. It won't be a big difference, though, because they don't want to discourage radiologists from living in time zones with reduced coverage (most of their radiologists will be in the North American and Western European time zones, so coverage in Asia/Australia tends to be poor).|I don't know any veterinary or human radiologists who are concerned about AI taking our jobs in our lifetime. Perhaps we are all collectively delusional, but I doubt it.

There were two students in my class in their 50s, and several in their 30s and 40s. Really the biggest question is financial. If you’ve made enough money in your career up to now that you can fund the educational path without loans, you are good to go. If you need to take out major loans, then you’ll have to do some number crunching to figure out if you can make it work. Figure you’ll need 2-3 years to complete your academic and veterinary experience prerequisites, then 4 years of school means you’ll be in your mid-40s when you graduate. Tuition for 4 years will be $200-300K (depending on if you get into your in-state school). Most people need to budget another $100-150K for living expenses, but presumably your calculation will be different depending on your personal situation (Own your own home? Have a spouse/partner with a job? Have kids? Etc). \n",

That will be up a bit in 8 years (although tuition and living expenses may also be higher than the figures I listed). Many vets these days have trouble paying off their loans in 20-25 years and may go for an income-based repayment plan (in which the balance of your loans are forgiven after 20 or 25 years). So if at age 40 you are entering vet school in the same financial situation as the typical 22 year old student, you may end up spending your entire career as a vet paying off the loans.|The ones I remember were the Nextel phones.

You are already past the point of having the option to reject an internship \"offer\" without penalty.|There's no specific timeline after the match.

But don't approach it like a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a vet. It would be like becoming a Registered Nurse as a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a Medical Doctor. Essentially, you should view it as a backup career option, which is not totally unreasonable as the acceptance rate for vet school is like 8-12%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that although there is overlap in knowledge between the two careers, most of the classes you take aren't applicable to vet school pre-reqs (as far as I'm aware). So after you got your CVT, you would then need to go back to school and take all the vet school requirements. Furthermore, it is generally advantageous to have varied animal/industry experience, not just all small animal clinical experience. Do you know how many vet school applicants are small animal clinical vet techs/assistants? Like, almost all of them. It's very hard to differentiate yourself when you're an Animal Science major and working as a small animal vet tech/assistant like 90% of the applicants. Vet schools like to see people with experience in large/farm animal, exotics, lab animal, wildlife, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if you are happy with the idea of being a CVT as a career, and applying for vet school is more of a shot in the dark, it's a fine strategy. But if you're pretty focused/set on getting into vet school, there's better ways to spend your time and money to maximize your chances of getting in.|You probably won't like this answer, but it is quite difficult to become great at radiographs without active guidance. There's the adage of needing 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something, but what's usually lost from that concept is that it's 10,000 hours of \\*\\*guided\\*\\* practice. That is, being supervised by a teacher, trainer, coach, etc. to correct your mistakes and reinforce your successes. Without the guidance, you are very likely just reinforcing your bad habits. I have met many GPs and ER vets with years of experience who \\*think\\* they are good at rads, but in reality are probably worse than an average vet student who just finished their radiology rotation. To take it a step further, even radiologists who are working solo and/or teleradiology exclusive and therefore very rarely getting second opinions on their reads or followup from surgeons and pathologists also end up reinforcing bad habits. Without surgeons and pathologists to keep us honest, we may as well believe we have a 100% accuracy rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the hardest part about learning to read radiographs is being able to differentiate normal from abnormal. This is a lot harder than it sounds, because there is a very wide range of \"normal\" and it overlaps with a lot of \"abnormal.\" And what I mean by normal is \"no clinically significant abnormalities\", which is different from \"textbook normal.\" A prime example of this is abdominal radiographs on a patient with acute vomiting and diarrhea. Most of the time, I read these out as normal abdomen. The intern or ER doc may then come and ask, so these don't look like gastroenteritis? To which I ask, what are the radiographic signs of gastroenteritis? And they don't answer, because of course there aren't really any specific radiographic signs of gastroenteritis. I may see some things that I associate more often with gastroenteritis — fragmented gas pattern in the jejunum, diffuse gas dilation of the GI tract, etc. — and if the clinical history fits I may conclude acute gastroenteritis so the ordering clinician feels better about their workup. But in reality, those radiographic signs are pretty common in animals with no GI symptoms at all, so it wouldn't be wrong to just conclude \"normal abdomen.\" The goal of abdominal rads in the acutely vomiting animal is not to rule \\*\\*in\\*\\* gastroenteritis, it is to rule \\*\\*out\\*\\* mechanical obstruction, radiopaque foreign material, or other gross abnormalities like abdominal mass effect or ascites. \"Normal abdomen\" effectively rules those things out, leaving you with a provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis so long as the remainder of the clinical picture fits (i.e., not in acute renal failure, liver failure, Addisonian crisis, etc.). \n",
      "\n",
      "So ultimately this is where reading textbooks like Thrall is useful, even if the example images aren't amazing. You learn what the actual radiographic signs are that are classically associated with disease processes. There isn't really a better overall textbook out there than Thrall. For thorax specifically though, I like the BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Thoracic Imaging: [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/BSAVA+Manual+of+Canine+and+Feline+Thoracic+Imaging-p-9780905214979](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/bsava+manual+of+canine+and+feline+thoracic+imaging-p-9780905214979) It's a little bit dated (published 2008) but it's not like there have been major advances in thoracic radiography since then. The BSAVA abdomen and MSK books are decent, but not as good as the thorax one.\n",

I've never even owned a dog.|With the understanding that this Reddit post is not a job ad, biggest immediate red flag is “competitive wage.” Everyone says that, I’ve never seen any job ad that declares their salary not to be competitive. There’s a shortage of vets, and we’re inundated with recruiting emails. It’s not uncommon for us to simply delete/ignore any ads that don’t list an actual salary range. For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location. Including production, I would bet it’s not unusual for vets in OR to be making $180-200K. \n",

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that.

They are generally customized for an individual resident, and the \"alternative\" aspect is usually that the supervising radiologists will be spread out over 2 or more institutions rather than all in one location. There is still a requirement that a residency director be on location at the primary hospital for at least 50% of the time, and at least one other supervising radiologist (but typically more than one) be available for immediate live clinical consultation/interaction the rest of the time (usually meaning the resident goes to a different hospital with a radiologist, or the other radiologist is a contracted locum at the primary hospital, but technically could also be a virtual locum on a Zoom call all day). \n",

There is still a requirement of at least 2 boarded radiologists to establish an alternative track residency, so if you are restricted in not being able to leave your geographic area, there needs to be two radiologists within your radius who agree to take on this task of training you.|What niche branch/specialty are you talking about?

Realistically, in order to lose a case like that, you'd have to have a radiologist willing to testify that your miss was a major error that affected the outcome of the case and that a general practitioner should be expected to identify. Any doctor, radiologist or not, who claims that loss of serosal detail in the right cranial quadrant is a sure sign of pancreatitis that shouldn't be missed is full of shit. As a radiologist, I am well aware of all the classical radiographic signs of pancreatitis, and anecdotally based on followup abdominal ultrasounds in these cases I can confidently say the classical signs of pancreatitis on radiographs are both poorly sensitive and poorly specific.

I still wouldn't be overly concerned about being sued, as your error would have to be pretty egregious for a radiologist to testify that you should be penalized for it, but as a matter of basic medical standard and patient care you should maybe be concerned.

      "1. Applicants who have years of experience in lieu of a rotating internship are generally at a disadvantage. The key is what the nature of your experience is. If you're working for 3 years as an ER vet in a referral hospital with all the standard specialties that one would have at a rotating internship, that is good experience. If you're working for 2 years in a general practice with minimal to no direct exposure to (boarded) specialists, that's bad experience. \n",
      "2. An internship recognized by EBVS is *probably* valid, but I would guess it is viewed as second tier unless it is well enough known as to be internationally reputable.\n",
      "3. Recs from vets in the UK would hold weight, so long as the vets are boarded specialists. DACVS probably holds more weight than DECVS, but only by a little.\n",
      "4. I have no idea how you would get involved in publishing something at a private clinic. It really just depends on whether you have contact with a boarded specialist who is willing to co-author the paper with you.\n",
      "5. The surgery diploma may help a little bit, but not much. Any ACVS residency is likely to be quite skeptical of the diploma/certificate, since they don't really know how rigorous the criteria are for passing. It would likely simply be viewed as \"candidate demonstrates an interest in small animal surgery.\"\n",
      "6. GPA comparison is very challenging unless the residency happens to have a faculty surgeon who is familiar with your school. If a class rank is available and can be shared as part of your application, that may hold more weight than straight GPA.\n",

      "Ultimately, the thing that residencies want to know is whether you will pass your boards and whether you will be a functional part of a surgery department for the 3 years of residency. The best way for them to know this is by having references from DACVS vets who know the candidate well and can vouch for their ability to survive a residency. This is the reason why DACVS references are preferred – they have been through the residency and passed the ACVS boards. DECVS may be perfectly knowledgeable and skilled surgeons, but they have not gone through an ACVS residency and passed those boards. There is an assumption that the two are probably close enough that a DECVS can evaluate whether a candidate is residency material, but again, if you have no DACVS references you are likely at a disadvantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the internship vs experience and the utility of the 1 year surgery diploma/certificate, ultimately the problem is that this is \"nontraditional\" for a candidate for an ACVS residency.

Last year, there were 238 applicants for 54 spots, with a match rate of 22.27%. More than 4 applicants for every 1 spot. And the vast majority of those applicants went to an AVMA-Accredited school, did a rotating internship in the US or Canada, and the vast majority of successful applicants also have one or more surgical internships as well. \n",

      "ACVS residencies have decided that this background – good grades at accredited school, rotating internship, surgical internship, multiple good DACVS references – is a good predictor of success for a resident. And there are more applicants who fit this profile than there are residency spots. So for you to supplant one of those candidates as a Spanish vet school grad, with no rotating internship, no surgical internship, and no DACVS references, you basically have to be a total rock star of a surgery candidate, and your DECVS references will need to say so emphatically.|\"Recognized\" is a nebulous word. Because vet med is minimally regulated in the US, anybody can do anything once they have a license. There are plenty of self-styled orthopedic \"specialists\" who have never been through a residency and are certainly not board-certified surgeons. But are boarded European specialists generally considered equivalent to the American specialist counterparts? Yes. At least in radiology, for example, a DECVDI is counted as a DACVR equivalent for the purpose of ACVR residency accreditation. Mind you, we are talking about boarded specialists here, not the Advanced Practitioner certificates.\n",

      "To work as a vet in the US, you either have to have passed your NAVLE, or you have to work under the umbrella license of a university teaching hospital.

So if you are a DECVS who has not passed the NAVLE (either directly or after having gone through ECFVG or PAVE certification first), your only option is to work at a university.

To me this sounds like there's one vet who owns the clinic is looking to retire, allowing the new vet to rename/rebrand however they like. Most people these days are looking to work in a larger team environment, as opposed to being effectively a solo practitioner. This also begs the question of how many support staff are there for the X number of vets? Especially how many RVTs, how many VAs, how many kennel attendants, how many receptionists, and is there a practice manager?|There are no reliable data, that I'm aware of.

I graduated from college in the late 90s, had several family members who were MDs including my father and a couple of my older cousins. So I kind of knew where medicine was headed, and I also really disliked the pre-med students in college, and didn't want to spend my life calling them my colleagues. One of my friends was pre-vet, and she was pretty cool, so I switched sides (took a couple years off after college to pursue other random things but eventually settled on vet school).|Starting salary for a small animal private practice GP is about $130k right now, so the simple math says yes, the two additional years of working salary is worth the higher tuition.|That starts getting complicated. So if we assume 10% interest rate (which is higher than it is right now, I think), over 7 years you accrue $106k on a $270k loan, bringing you up to $376k when you finish in the US. On a $400k loan over 5 years at 10%, you accrue $109k in interest, putting you at $509k when you finish in the UK. That's a difference of $133k. In order for you to bridge that gap in the two years of working, you'd need to put in somewhere around $6k per month towards your loans.\n",

For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location.

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",

      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",

      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that.

It depends of course on what branch of vet med you go into, and to some degree your own job selection (some people are just workaholics), but if when you say \"one of my parents works in human medicine\" you mean that they are a physician or work a physician's schedule, then you probably have a good idea of the time commitment. An average small animal clinical vet might have a schedule that looks like 4 weekday 10 hour shifts, a rotating weekend schedule that might be one Saturday per month, and likely 3-4 weeks vacation per year. Many vets end up having to spend extra time after their shift end to finish paperwork and do some client callbacks, so on average 40-50 hours per week actually working plus their weekend rotation. \n",

If you need to take out major loans, then you’ll have to do some number crunching to figure out if you can make it work. Figure you’ll need 2-3 years to complete your academic and veterinary experience prerequisites, then 4 years of school means you’ll be in your mid-40s when you graduate. Tuition for 4 years will be $200-300K (depending on if you get into your in-state school). Most people need to budget another $100-150K for living expenses, but presumably your calculation will be different depending on your personal situation (Own your own home?

Many vets these days have trouble paying off their loans in 20-25 years and may go for an income-based repayment plan (in which the balance of your loans are forgiven after 20 or 25 years).

      "If you are going to reject the internship, out of professional courtesy you should do that ASAP when you get your match result. You will still be penalized by the VIRMP with the 3 year freeze, and you likely will go on a Do Not Hire list at the institution, but you at least give the institution the opportunity to scramble and find a replacement for the internship spot you are vacating. \n",
      "\n",
      "You should probably be aware also that even after the 3 year VIRMP freeze, you would be seriously damaging your chances of ever matching in the future. Vet Med is a surprisingly small world, and many people (especially in academia) are well connected. Your decision to reject an internship after the match will reflect poorly on the faculty who wrote your reference letters, and they will almost certainly not agree to write you another letter if you decide to reapply in the future. Chances are none of your other current faculty would be comfortable writing a letter for you after a 3 year hiatus (especially knowing the reason for the hiatus). So during those three years you would need to establish new positive working relationships, ideally with boarded specialists, who would write your reference letters and directly address your previous actions. Even then, many internship programs would likely view your application with a very big red flag, unless there was an extenuating circumstance like an immediate family member fell ill and you had to pause/upend your career path in order to take care of them.|If you have the time and money to spend on training to be a CVT, it's fine. But don't approach it like a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a vet. It would be like becoming a Registered Nurse as a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a Medical Doctor. Essentially, you should view it as a backup career option, which is not totally unreasonable as the acceptance rate for vet school is like 8-12%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that although there is overlap in knowledge between the two careers, most of the classes you take aren't applicable to vet school pre-reqs (as far as I'm aware). So after you got your CVT, you would then need to go back to school and take all the vet school requirements. Furthermore, it is generally advantageous to have varied animal/industry experience, not just all small animal clinical experience. Do you know how many vet school applicants are small animal clinical vet techs/assistants? Like, almost all of them. It's very hard to differentiate yourself when you're an Animal Science major and working as a small animal vet tech/assistant like 90% of the applicants. Vet schools like to see people with experience in large/farm animal, exotics, lab animal, wildlife, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if you are happy with the idea of being a CVT as a career, and applying for vet school is more of a shot in the dark, it's a fine strategy. But if you're pretty focused/set on getting into vet school, there's better ways to spend your time and money to maximize your chances of getting in.|You probably won't like this answer, but it is quite difficult to become great at radiographs without active guidance. There's the adage of needing 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something, but what's usually lost from that concept is that it's 10,000 hours of \\*\\*guided\\*\\* practice. That is, being supervised by a teacher, trainer, coach, etc. to correct your mistakes and reinforce your successes. Without the guidance, you are very likely just reinforcing your bad habits. I have met many GPs and ER vets with years of experience who \\*think\\* they are good at rads, but in reality are probably worse than an average vet student who just finished their radiology rotation. To take it a step further, even radiologists who are working solo and/or teleradiology exclusive and therefore very rarely getting second opinions on their reads or followup from surgeons and pathologists also end up reinforcing bad habits. Without surgeons and pathologists to keep us honest, we may as well believe we have a 100% accuracy rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the hardest part about learning to read radiographs is being able to differentiate normal from abnormal. This is a lot harder than it sounds, because there is a very wide range of \"normal\" and it overlaps with a lot of \"abnormal.\" And what I mean by normal is \"no clinically significant abnormalities\", which is different from \"textbook normal.\" A prime example of this is abdominal radiographs on a patient with acute vomiting and diarrhea. Most of the time, I read these out as normal abdomen. The intern or ER doc may then come and ask, so these don't look like gastroenteritis? To which I ask, what are the radiographic signs of gastroenteritis? And they don't answer, because of course there aren't really any specific radiographic signs of gastroenteritis. I may see some things that I associate more often with gastroenteritis — fragmented gas pattern in the jejunum, diffuse gas dilation of the GI tract, etc. — and if the clinical history fits I may conclude acute gastroenteritis so the ordering clinician feels better about their workup. But in reality, those radiographic signs are pretty common in animals with no GI symptoms at all, so it wouldn't be wrong to just conclude \"normal abdomen.\" The goal of abdominal rads in the acutely vomiting animal is not to rule \\*\\*in\\*\\* gastroenteritis, it is to rule \\*\\*out\\*\\* mechanical obstruction, radiopaque foreign material, or other gross abnormalities like abdominal mass effect or ascites. \"Normal abdomen\" effectively rules those things out, leaving you with a provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis so long as the remainder of the clinical picture fits (i.e., not in acute renal failure, liver failure, Addisonian crisis, etc.). \n",
      "\n",
      "So ultimately this is where reading textbooks like Thrall is useful, even if the example images aren't amazing. You learn what the actual radiographic signs are that are classically associated with disease processes. There isn't really a better overall textbook out there than Thrall. For thorax specifically though, I like the BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Thoracic Imaging: [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/BSAVA+Manual+of+Canine+and+Feline+Thoracic+Imaging-p-9780905214979](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/bsava+manual+of+canine+and+feline+thoracic+imaging-p-9780905214979) It's a little bit dated (published 2008) but it's not like there have been major advances in thoracic radiography since then.

There’s a shortage of vets, and we’re inundated with recruiting emails. It’s not uncommon for us to simply delete/ignore any ads that don’t list an actual salary range. For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location. Including production, I would bet it’s not unusual for vets in OR to be making $180-200K. \n",

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you.

They are generally customized for an individual resident, and the \"alternative\" aspect is usually that the supervising radiologists will be spread out over 2 or more institutions rather than all in one location. There is still a requirement that a residency director be on location at the primary hospital for at least 50% of the time, and at least one other supervising radiologist (but typically more than one) be available for immediate live clinical consultation/interaction the rest of the time (usually meaning the resident goes to a different hospital with a radiologist, or the other radiologist is a contracted locum at the primary hospital, but technically could also be a virtual locum on a Zoom call all day). \n",

Realistically, in order to lose a case like that, you'd have to have a radiologist willing to testify that your miss was a major error that affected the outcome of the case and that a general practitioner should be expected to identify. Any doctor, radiologist or not, who claims that loss of serosal detail in the right cranial quadrant is a sure sign of pancreatitis that shouldn't be missed is full of shit. As a radiologist, I am well aware of all the classical radiographic signs of pancreatitis, and anecdotally based on followup abdominal ultrasounds in these cases I can confidently say the classical signs of pancreatitis on radiographs are both poorly sensitive and poorly specific.

I still wouldn't be overly concerned about being sued, as your error would have to be pretty egregious for a radiologist to testify that you should be penalized for it, but as a matter of basic medical standard and patient care you should maybe be concerned.

      "4. I have no idea how you would get involved in publishing something at a private clinic. It really just depends on whether you have contact with a boarded specialist who is willing to co-author the paper with you.\n",
      "5. The surgery diploma may help a little bit, but not much. Any ACVS residency is likely to be quite skeptical of the diploma/certificate, since they don't really know how rigorous the criteria are for passing. It would likely simply be viewed as \"candidate demonstrates an interest in small animal surgery.\"\n",
      "6. GPA comparison is very challenging unless the residency happens to have a faculty surgeon who is familiar with your school. If a class rank is available and can be shared as part of your application, that may hold more weight than straight GPA.\n",

      "Ultimately, the thing that residencies want to know is whether you will pass your boards and whether you will be a functional part of a surgery department for the 3 years of residency. The best way for them to know this is by having references from DACVS vets who know the candidate well and can vouch for their ability to survive a residency. This is the reason why DACVS references are preferred – they have been through the residency and passed the ACVS boards. DECVS may be perfectly knowledgeable and skilled surgeons, but they have not gone through an ACVS residency and passed those boards. There is an assumption that the two are probably close enough that a DECVS can evaluate whether a candidate is residency material, but again, if you have no DACVS references you are likely at a disadvantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the internship vs experience and the utility of the 1 year surgery diploma/certificate, ultimately the problem is that this is \"nontraditional\" for a candidate for an ACVS residency. There are many, many qualified applicants with a more traditional education/training background, many more than the number of residency spots. Last year, there were 238 applicants for 54 spots, with a match rate of 22.27%. More than 4 applicants for every 1 spot. And the vast majority of those applicants went to an AVMA-Accredited school, did a rotating internship in the US or Canada, and the vast majority of successful applicants also have one or more surgical internships as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "ACVS residencies have decided that this background – good grades at accredited school, rotating internship, surgical internship, multiple good DACVS references – is a good predictor of success for a resident. And there are more applicants who fit this profile than there are residency spots. So for you to supplant one of those candidates as a Spanish vet school grad, with no rotating internship, no surgical internship, and no DACVS references, you basically have to be a total rock star of a surgery candidate, and your DECVS references will need to say so emphatically.|\"Recognized\" is a nebulous word. Because vet med is minimally regulated in the US, anybody can do anything once they have a license. There are plenty of self-styled orthopedic \"specialists\" who have never been through a residency and are certainly not board-certified surgeons. But are boarded European specialists generally considered equivalent to the American specialist counterparts? Yes. At least in radiology, for example, a DECVDI is counted as a DACVR equivalent for the purpose of ACVR residency accreditation. Mind you, we are talking about boarded specialists here, not the Advanced Practitioner certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "To work as a vet in the US, you either have to have passed your NAVLE, or you have to work under the umbrella license of a university teaching hospital. This applies to boarded specialists as well. Having a DECVS or DECVDI does not allow you to bypass the need for a valid medical license. So if you are a DECVS who has not passed the NAVLE (either directly or after having gone through ECFVG or PAVE certification first), your only option is to work at a university. That said, there are many such European specialists working at universities, because academia pays like crap so it's hard to attract and retain faculty. \n",

Most people these days are looking to work in a larger team environment, as opposed to being effectively a solo practitioner. This also begs the question of how many support staff are there for the X number of vets? Especially how many RVTs, how many VAs, how many kennel attendants, how many receptionists, and is there a practice manager?|There are no reliable data, that I'm aware of.

So if we assume 10% interest rate (which is higher than it is right now, I think), over 7 years you accrue $106k on a $270k loan, bringing you up to $376k when you finish in the US. On a $400k loan over 5 years at 10%, you accrue $109k in interest, putting you at $509k when you finish in the UK. That's a difference of $133k.

For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location.

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that.

It depends of course on what branch of vet med you go into, and to some degree your own job selection (some people are just workaholics), but if when you say \"one of my parents works in human medicine\" you mean that they are a physician or work a physician's schedule, then you probably have a good idea of the time commitment. An average small animal clinical vet might have a schedule that looks like 4 weekday 10 hour shifts, a rotating weekend schedule that might be one Saturday per month, and likely 3-4 weeks vacation per year. Many vets end up having to spend extra time after their shift end to finish paperwork and do some client callbacks, so on average 40-50 hours per week actually working plus their weekend rotation. \n",

If you need to take out major loans, then you’ll have to do some number crunching to figure out if you can make it work. Figure you’ll need 2-3 years to complete your academic and veterinary experience prerequisites, then 4 years of school means you’ll be in your mid-40s when you graduate. Tuition for 4 years will be $200-300K (depending on if you get into your in-state school). Most people need to budget another $100-150K for living expenses, but presumably your calculation will be different depending on your personal situation (Own your own home?

Many vets these days have trouble paying off their loans in 20-25 years and may go for an income-based repayment plan (in which the balance of your loans are forgiven after 20 or 25 years).

      "One of the most important aspects of participation in the VIRMP is the early commitment which is made by the applicant; that is, the applicant must agree to accept a position at any of the institutions or private practices which he/she ranked. When creating an account, the applicant will electronically sign an agreement to this effect. Failure to comply will result in sanctions including a ban from participation in the VIRMP for at least 3 years. This agreement must be completed online no later than February 16, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the deadline to withdraw has already passed. The match is not a traditional job offer/acceptance situation. When you signed the electronic commitment, that was your acceptance of whatever \"job offer\" is assigned to you by the match program. You have already accepted any potential job offer from all the internship programs you decided to apply for. You are already past the point of having the option to reject an internship \"offer\" without penalty.|There's no specific timeline after the match. Essentially, at some point in the days/weeks after the match, your internship institution should contact you and provide information regarding starting dates, orientation schedule, state licensing info (if needed), and to request any personal information they need for employment/HR purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are going to reject the internship, out of professional courtesy you should do that ASAP when you get your match result. You will still be penalized by the VIRMP with the 3 year freeze, and you likely will go on a Do Not Hire list at the institution, but you at least give the institution the opportunity to scramble and find a replacement for the internship spot you are vacating. \n",
      "\n",
      "You should probably be aware also that even after the 3 year VIRMP freeze, you would be seriously damaging your chances of ever matching in the future. Vet Med is a surprisingly small world, and many people (especially in academia) are well connected. Your decision to reject an internship after the match will reflect poorly on the faculty who wrote your reference letters, and they will almost certainly not agree to write you another letter if you decide to reapply in the future. Chances are none of your other current faculty would be comfortable writing a letter for you after a 3 year hiatus (especially knowing the reason for the hiatus). So during those three years you would need to establish new positive working relationships, ideally with boarded specialists, who would write your reference letters and directly address your previous actions. Even then, many internship programs would likely view your application with a very big red flag, unless there was an extenuating circumstance like an immediate family member fell ill and you had to pause/upend your career path in order to take care of them.|If you have the time and money to spend on training to be a CVT, it's fine. But don't approach it like a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a vet. It would be like becoming a Registered Nurse as a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a Medical Doctor. Essentially, you should view it as a backup career option, which is not totally unreasonable as the acceptance rate for vet school is like 8-12%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that although there is overlap in knowledge between the two careers, most of the classes you take aren't applicable to vet school pre-reqs (as far as I'm aware). So after you got your CVT, you would then need to go back to school and take all the vet school requirements. Furthermore, it is generally advantageous to have varied animal/industry experience, not just all small animal clinical experience. Do you know how many vet school applicants are small animal clinical vet techs/assistants? Like, almost all of them. It's very hard to differentiate yourself when you're an Animal Science major and working as a small animal vet tech/assistant like 90% of the applicants. Vet schools like to see people with experience in large/farm animal, exotics, lab animal, wildlife, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if you are happy with the idea of being a CVT as a career, and applying for vet school is more of a shot in the dark, it's a fine strategy. But if you're pretty focused/set on getting into vet school, there's better ways to spend your time and money to maximize your chances of getting in.|You probably won't like this answer, but it is quite difficult to become great at radiographs without active guidance. There's the adage of needing 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something, but what's usually lost from that concept is that it's 10,000 hours of \\*\\*guided\\*\\* practice. That is, being supervised by a teacher, trainer, coach, etc. to correct your mistakes and reinforce your successes. Without the guidance, you are very likely just reinforcing your bad habits. I have met many GPs and ER vets with years of experience who \\*think\\* they are good at rads, but in reality are probably worse than an average vet student who just finished their radiology rotation. To take it a step further, even radiologists who are working solo and/or teleradiology exclusive and therefore very rarely getting second opinions on their reads or followup from surgeons and pathologists also end up reinforcing bad habits. Without surgeons and pathologists to keep us honest, we may as well believe we have a 100% accuracy rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the hardest part about learning to read radiographs is being able to differentiate normal from abnormal. This is a lot harder than it sounds, because there is a very wide range of \"normal\" and it overlaps with a lot of \"abnormal.\" And what I mean by normal is \"no clinically significant abnormalities\", which is different from \"textbook normal.\" A prime example of this is abdominal radiographs on a patient with acute vomiting and diarrhea. Most of the time, I read these out as normal abdomen. The intern or ER doc may then come and ask, so these don't look like gastroenteritis? To which I ask, what are the radiographic signs of gastroenteritis? And they don't answer, because of course there aren't really any specific radiographic signs of gastroenteritis. I may see some things that I associate more often with gastroenteritis — fragmented gas pattern in the jejunum, diffuse gas dilation of the GI tract, etc. — and if the clinical history fits I may conclude acute gastroenteritis so the ordering clinician feels better about their workup. But in reality, those radiographic signs are pretty common in animals with no GI symptoms at all, so it wouldn't be wrong to just conclude \"normal abdomen.\" The goal of abdominal rads in the acutely vomiting animal is not to rule \\*\\*in\\*\\* gastroenteritis, it is to rule \\*\\*out\\*\\* mechanical obstruction, radiopaque foreign material, or other gross abnormalities like abdominal mass effect or ascites. \"Normal abdomen\" effectively rules those things out, leaving you with a provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis so long as the remainder of the clinical picture fits (i.e., not in acute renal failure, liver failure, Addisonian crisis, etc.). \n",
      "\n",
      "So ultimately this is where reading textbooks like Thrall is useful, even if the example images aren't amazing. You learn what the actual radiographic signs are that are classically associated with disease processes. There isn't really a better overall textbook out there than Thrall. For thorax specifically though, I like the BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Thoracic Imaging: [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/BSAVA+Manual+of+Canine+and+Feline+Thoracic+Imaging-p-9780905214979](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/bsava+manual+of+canine+and+feline+thoracic+imaging-p-9780905214979) It's a little bit dated (published 2008) but it's not like there have been major advances in thoracic radiography since then. The BSAVA abdomen and MSK books are decent, but not as good as the thorax one.\n",

I've never even owned a dog.|With the understanding that this Reddit post is not a job ad, biggest immediate red flag is “competitive wage.” Everyone says that, I’ve never seen any job ad that declares their salary not to be competitive. There’s a shortage of vets, and we’re inundated with recruiting emails. It’s not uncommon for us to simply delete/ignore any ads that don’t list an actual salary range. For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location. Including production, I would bet it’s not unusual for vets in OR to be making $180-200K. \n",

      "If you are a 501(c)(3) organization then new grads working for you should qualify for federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which is effectively a six figure bonus at the 10 year mark, paid for by the federal government.

      "\n",
      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations. A good nonprofit has to be run like a normal for-profit hospital, and then there has to be great fundraising and establishment of trust and engagement with the community. Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org. And of course the Animal Medical Center in NYC and Angell in Boston are two of the largest and oldest specialty hospitals in the country, both also 501(c)(3) orgs.|I am not sure about Australia, but in the US most interventional radiologists are actually not radiologists. Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that. I don't know the pathology dept at NCSU specifically, but most pathology depts are usually pretty welcoming to any students who show real interest in pathology.|You need to put actual numbers in your job ads as a bare minimum to get any interest.

They are generally customized for an individual resident, and the \"alternative\" aspect is usually that the supervising radiologists will be spread out over 2 or more institutions rather than all in one location. There is still a requirement that a residency director be on location at the primary hospital for at least 50% of the time, and at least one other supervising radiologist (but typically more than one) be available for immediate live clinical consultation/interaction the rest of the time (usually meaning the resident goes to a different hospital with a radiologist, or the other radiologist is a contracted locum at the primary hospital, but technically could also be a virtual locum on a Zoom call all day). \n",

Realistically, in order to lose a case like that, you'd have to have a radiologist willing to testify that your miss was a major error that affected the outcome of the case and that a general practitioner should be expected to identify. Any doctor, radiologist or not, who claims that loss of serosal detail in the right cranial quadrant is a sure sign of pancreatitis that shouldn't be missed is full of shit. As a radiologist, I am well aware of all the classical radiographic signs of pancreatitis, and anecdotally based on followup abdominal ultrasounds in these cases I can confidently say the classical signs of pancreatitis on radiographs are both poorly sensitive and poorly specific.

I still wouldn't be overly concerned about being sued, as your error would have to be pretty egregious for a radiologist to testify that you should be penalized for it, but as a matter of basic medical standard and patient care you should maybe be concerned.

And equivalent-level MD specialists will still make around twice as much as the veterinary specialist (i.e., while a veterinary surgeon may make $350-400K, an MD surgeon will make $700-800K).|I am not a surgeon (I am a radiologist) but I will take a stab at some of your questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Applicants who have years of experience in lieu of a rotating internship are generally at a disadvantage. The key is what the nature of your experience is. If you're working for 3 years as an ER vet in a referral hospital with all the standard specialties that one would have at a rotating internship, that is good experience. If you're working for 2 years in a general practice with minimal to no direct exposure to (boarded) specialists, that's bad experience. \n",
      "2. An internship recognized by EBVS is *probably* valid, but I would guess it is viewed as second tier unless it is well enough known as to be internationally reputable.\n",
      "3. Recs from vets in the UK would hold weight, so long as the vets are boarded specialists. DACVS probably holds more weight than DECVS, but only by a little.\n",
      "4. I have no idea how you would get involved in publishing something at a private clinic. It really just depends on whether you have contact with a boarded specialist who is willing to co-author the paper with you.\n",
      "5. The surgery diploma may help a little bit, but not much. Any ACVS residency is likely to be quite skeptical of the diploma/certificate, since they don't really know how rigorous the criteria are for passing. It would likely simply be viewed as \"candidate demonstrates an interest in small animal surgery.\"\n",
      "6. GPA comparison is very challenging unless the residency happens to have a faculty surgeon who is familiar with your school. If a class rank is available and can be shared as part of your application, that may hold more weight than straight GPA.\n",
      "7. They won't skip over your application without ECFVG/NAVLE, but you are likely at some kind of disadvantage without it. Also note that without ECFVG/NAVLE, even if you pass your boards you would be restricted to working at a university teaching hospital in the US.\n",
      "8. The most important part of the residency application is your references. Ideally, if you can find a surgeon (or two) who are double boarded in ACVS and ECVS to write letters, that's the best thing you can do. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the thing that residencies want to know is whether you will pass your boards and whether you will be a functional part of a surgery department for the 3 years of residency. The best way for them to know this is by having references from DACVS vets who know the candidate well and can vouch for their ability to survive a residency. This is the reason why DACVS references are preferred – they have been through the residency and passed the ACVS boards. DECVS may be perfectly knowledgeable and skilled surgeons, but they have not gone through an ACVS residency and passed those boards. There is an assumption that the two are probably close enough that a DECVS can evaluate whether a candidate is residency material, but again, if you have no DACVS references you are likely at a disadvantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the internship vs experience and the utility of the 1 year surgery diploma/certificate, ultimately the problem is that this is \"nontraditional\" for a candidate for an ACVS residency. There are many, many qualified applicants with a more traditional education/training background, many more than the number of residency spots. Last year, there were 238 applicants for 54 spots, with a match rate of 22.27%. More than 4 applicants for every 1 spot. And the vast majority of those applicants went to an AVMA-Accredited school, did a rotating internship in the US or Canada, and the vast majority of successful applicants also have one or more surgical internships as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "ACVS residencies have decided that this background – good grades at accredited school, rotating internship, surgical internship, multiple good DACVS references – is a good predictor of success for a resident. And there are more applicants who fit this profile than there are residency spots. So for you to supplant one of those candidates as a Spanish vet school grad, with no rotating internship, no surgical internship, and no DACVS references, you basically have to be a total rock star of a surgery candidate, and your DECVS references will need to say so emphatically.|\"Recognized\" is a nebulous word. Because vet med is minimally regulated in the US, anybody can do anything once they have a license. There are plenty of self-styled orthopedic \"specialists\" who have never been through a residency and are certainly not board-certified surgeons. But are boarded European specialists generally considered equivalent to the American specialist counterparts? Yes. At least in radiology, for example, a DECVDI is counted as a DACVR equivalent for the purpose of ACVR residency accreditation. Mind you, we are talking about boarded specialists here, not the Advanced Practitioner certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "To work as a vet in the US, you either have to have passed your NAVLE, or you have to work under the umbrella license of a university teaching hospital. This applies to boarded specialists as well. Having a DECVS or DECVDI does not allow you to bypass the need for a valid medical license. So if you are a DECVS who has not passed the NAVLE (either directly or after having gone through ECFVG or PAVE certification first), your only option is to work at a university. That said, there are many such European specialists working at universities, because academia pays like crap so it's hard to attract and retain faculty. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think that if your general vet med education is still fresh in your mind, and your plan (being a US citizen) is to live/work in the US permanently, it would be advisable to go through the ECFVG. Even with the cost, you will make a LOT more money if you have the ability to work in private practice, whether as a GP, an ER vet, or a specialist.|As many have already noted, the salary is pretty low. $125K is the mean starting salary for 2023 new graduates in private practice. Mean/average salary, meaning a very significant number of new grads are making more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond that, though, what is the clinic organization and working conditions? 20% ownership at signing and \"can change the name to whatever they want\" suggests this new employee has immediate full control of the practice itself. To me this sounds like there's one vet who owns the clinic is looking to retire, allowing the new vet to rename/rebrand however they like. Most people these days are looking to work in a larger team environment, as opposed to being effectively a solo practitioner. This also begs the question of how many support staff are there for the X number of vets? Especially how many RVTs, how many VAs, how many kennel attendants, how many receptionists, and is there a practice manager?|There are no reliable data, that I'm aware of. And salaries across the board in vet med have changed drastically since the pandemic, so any data you find from 2020 or earlier is likely so outdated as to be totally useless at this point. There may be internal data within the cardiology college (ACVIM) but I am not privy to it if so. \n",
      "\n",
      "Generally speaking, cardiologists are in high demand and make a lot of money. Especially if you decide to work as a mobile practitioner, and even more so if you learn basic abdominal ultrasound and add that to your mobile services. As a basic rule of thumb, simply by being in a major clinical specialty, you probably will be making $250K at bare minimum. I would guess the average cardiologist makes around $350K, and I personally know cardiologists making over $400K, which is probably mid-upper range for private practice. I would not be surprised if mobile cardiologists are making $500K+. This is all wild speculation, though.\n",

      "Academia is a totally different ballgame, and most likely the average academic cardiologist makes $100-150K, basically the same as a private practice GP.

For almost all residency types, the most important aspect of the residency application is the letters of recommendation.

If you are a Canadian citizen, that obviously is not a problem if you are applying to programs in Canada. In terms of the education, if it's an AVMA accredited school I don't think most places will knock you down in the pecking order. Many of the most well-regarded vet schools in the world are outside the US.|If you are at an AVMA accredited school there will be plenty of specialists to network with. And then ideally wherever you do an internship there will also be many additional specialists.|Yes, basically any larger referral hospital or teaching hospital with a radiology department (i.e., has radiologists on staff) will have full time techs working in the radiology department. Veterinary radiology tech backgrounds run the gamut: vet assistants who are trained on-the-job to acquire imaging studies, registered vet techs (RVT) who are trained on-the-job and who may progress to vet tech specialization (VTS, involves benchmarks for experience and then passing a certifying exam), human medical radiologic technologists (RT) who shift to vet med part time or full time, human medical registered diagnostic medical sonographers (RDMS) who shift to vet med part time or full time. \n",

I graduated from college in the late 90s, had several family members who were MDs including my father and a couple of my older cousins. So I kind of knew where medicine was headed, and I also really disliked the pre-med students in college, and didn't want to spend my life calling them my colleagues. One of my friends was pre-vet, and she was pretty cool, so I switched sides (took a couple years off after college to pursue other random things but eventually settled on vet school).|Starting salary for a small animal private practice GP is about $130k right now, so the simple math says yes, the two additional years of working salary is worth the higher tuition.|That starts getting complicated. So if we assume 10% interest rate (which is higher than it is right now, I think), over 7 years you accrue $106k on a $270k loan, bringing you up to $376k when you finish in the US. On a $400k loan over 5 years at 10%, you accrue $109k in interest, putting you at $509k when you finish in the UK. That's a difference of $133k. In order for you to bridge that gap in the two years of working, you'd need to put in somewhere around $6k per month towards your loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a lot of variables, though, which can result in a significant change in the calculation. Obviously, the real cost of attendance is a big one, so if real cost of attendance in the UK is lower than you estimate, or the cost in the US is higher than you estimate, that will be a big change. Also whatever is that actual interest rate you get will make a big difference. And lastly, if you are single and trying to pay off those loans, it may be a bit harder than if you're married and your spouse is working and is willing to also contribute towards your debt.\n",

There’s a shortage of vets, and we’re inundated with recruiting emails. It’s not uncommon for us to simply delete/ignore any ads that don’t list an actual salary range. For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location. Including production, I would bet it’s not unusual for vets in OR to be making $180-200K. \n",

      "If you are a 501(c)(3) organization then new grads working for you should qualify for federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which is effectively a six figure bonus at the 10 year mark, paid for by the federal government.

      "I would probably focus a lot of your recruiting at Oregon State, on the assumption there is some population of students there who are from Oregon, want to remain in Oregon, and are paying in-state tuition so they have a slightly lower loan burden. Those vet students also are less likely to be weighing offers from low cost of living areas like Oklahoma or Tennessee where $120K goes a lot farther. \n",
      "\n",
      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations. A good nonprofit has to be run like a normal for-profit hospital, and then there has to be great fundraising and establishment of trust and engagement with the community. Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org. And of course the Animal Medical Center in NYC and Angell in Boston are two of the largest and oldest specialty hospitals in the country, both also 501(c)(3) orgs.|I am not sure about Australia, but in the US most interventional radiologists are actually not radiologists. Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that. I don't know the pathology dept at NCSU specifically, but most pathology depts are usually pretty welcoming to any students who show real interest in pathology.|You need to put actual numbers in your job ads as a bare minimum to get any interest.

So I'd be looking for something in the neighborhood of $180,000 base and anticipated $213,000 including production as a bare minimum. And that's for a new graduate, so if you're serious about \"commensurate with experience\" then it should be higher than that for an experienced vet.|That is not unusual in the highest cost of living areas like Daly City (Bay Area) or NYC. In the same way that people in the lowest cost of living parts of the country like Oklahoma are getting offers with base salary in the $70-80K range which is 30% below average (despite cost of living only being 13% lower than national average). Veterinarians devaluing ourselves is definitely part of the problem that perpetuates our low pay relative other equivalently trained healthcare professionals.|Yes, most vets have free time, families, pets, and a life outside of work. It depends of course on what branch of vet med you go into, and to some degree your own job selection (some people are just workaholics), but if when you say \"one of my parents works in human medicine\" you mean that they are a physician or work a physician's schedule, then you probably have a good idea of the time commitment. An average small animal clinical vet might have a schedule that looks like 4 weekday 10 hour shifts, a rotating weekend schedule that might be one Saturday per month, and likely 3-4 weeks vacation per year. Many vets end up having to spend extra time after their shift end to finish paperwork and do some client callbacks, so on average 40-50 hours per week actually working plus their weekend rotation. \n",
      "\n",
      "And as I said, there's a very wide range depending on what area of vet med you go into. Some people might be ER vets, pulling 12-14 hour shifts for 3 days in row then have like a week off. Some might be specialist surgeons or neurologists, so they have to be on call for emergency surgery which can be very disruptive to routine life but comes with high pay. Some might work industry or government jobs and have a very predictable 9-5, M-F schedule. Some might be full time teleradiologists who work 25 hours total per week, all from home.|There's some imprecision/hand-waving in the description here. 6-12 months is a wide range. If you make 80k in 6 months, that's 160k for a year which is higher than the average vet salary in the US right now. 80k in 12 months would be more like the bottom of the range for a new grad in small animal private practice.

Most of the large global teleradiology companies pay quite well (in the US most full-time teleradiologists will make in the range of $300-600K (USD) annually. I think most of the large global teleradiology companies (Antech, IDEXX, VetCT, etc.) might have a slight differential pay for their radiologists based on cost of living in their country of residence, but I am not totally sure about that. It won't be a big difference, though, because they don't want to discourage radiologists from living in time zones with reduced coverage (most of their radiologists will be in the North American and Western European time zones, so coverage in Asia/Australia tends to be poor).|I don't know any veterinary or human radiologists who are concerned about AI taking our jobs in our lifetime. Perhaps we are all collectively delusional, but I doubt it.

There were two students in my class in their 50s, and several in their 30s and 40s. Really the biggest question is financial. If you’ve made enough money in your career up to now that you can fund the educational path without loans, you are good to go. If you need to take out major loans, then you’ll have to do some number crunching to figure out if you can make it work. Figure you’ll need 2-3 years to complete your academic and veterinary experience prerequisites, then 4 years of school means you’ll be in your mid-40s when you graduate. Tuition for 4 years will be $200-300K (depending on if you get into your in-state school). Most people need to budget another $100-150K for living expenses, but presumably your calculation will be different depending on your personal situation (Own your own home?

That will be up a bit in 8 years (although tuition and living expenses may also be higher than the figures I listed). Many vets these days have trouble paying off their loans in 20-25 years and may go for an income-based repayment plan (in which the balance of your loans are forgiven after 20 or 25 years). So if at age 40 you are entering vet school in the same financial situation as the typical 22 year old student, you may end up spending your entire career as a vet paying off the loans.|The ones I remember were the Nextel phones.

      "For radiology specifically, I cannot imagine any specialty currently that makes more money *per hour worked* than radiology. Most radiologists I know are working at least part time teleradiology and making about $400-500K for 40 hours/week. Those working full time teleradiology are making that amount for about 30 hours/week (and no commute). Those working full time in-house practice are making less, maybe $300-350K for 40-50 hours. Not bad at all, but comparable to other clinical specialties as opposed to absurd teleradiology bubble salary. One big advantage of radiology, of course, is that due to the lack of client contact and no need for referral letters, callbacks, sitting around talking about cases, and other such \"non-revenue generating\" activities, almost all the hours worked are productive.|According to the VIRMP site:\n",
      "\n",
      ">Commitment Process:  \n",
      "One of the most important aspects of participation in the VIRMP is the early commitment which is made by the applicant; that is, the applicant must agree to accept a position at any of the institutions or private practices which he/she ranked. When creating an account, the applicant will electronically sign an agreement to this effect. Failure to comply will result in sanctions including a ban from participation in the VIRMP for at least 3 years. This agreement must be completed online no later than February 16, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the deadline to withdraw has already passed. The match is not a traditional job offer/acceptance situation. When you signed the electronic commitment, that was your acceptance of whatever \"job offer\" is assigned to you by the match program. You have already accepted any potential job offer from all the internship programs you decided to apply for. You are already past the point of having the option to reject an internship \"offer\" without penalty.|There's no specific timeline after the match. Essentially, at some point in the days/weeks after the match, your internship institution should contact you and provide information regarding starting dates, orientation schedule, state licensing info (if needed), and to request any personal information they need for employment/HR purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are going to reject the internship, out of professional courtesy you should do that ASAP when you get your match result. You will still be penalized by the VIRMP with the 3 year freeze, and you likely will go on a Do Not Hire list at the institution, but you at least give the institution the opportunity to scramble and find a replacement for the internship spot you are vacating. \n",
      "\n",
      "You should probably be aware also that even after the 3 year VIRMP freeze, you would be seriously damaging your chances of ever matching in the future. Vet Med is a surprisingly small world, and many people (especially in academia) are well connected. Your decision to reject an internship after the match will reflect poorly on the faculty who wrote your reference letters, and they will almost certainly not agree to write you another letter if you decide to reapply in the future. Chances are none of your other current faculty would be comfortable writing a letter for you after a 3 year hiatus (especially knowing the reason for the hiatus). So during those three years you would need to establish new positive working relationships, ideally with boarded specialists, who would write your reference letters and directly address your previous actions. Even then, many internship programs would likely view your application with a very big red flag, unless there was an extenuating circumstance like an immediate family member fell ill and you had to pause/upend your career path in order to take care of them.|If you have the time and money to spend on training to be a CVT, it's fine. But don't approach it like a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a vet. It would be like becoming a Registered Nurse as a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a Medical Doctor. Essentially, you should view it as a backup career option, which is not totally unreasonable as the acceptance rate for vet school is like 8-12%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that although there is overlap in knowledge between the two careers, most of the classes you take aren't applicable to vet school pre-reqs (as far as I'm aware). So after you got your CVT, you would then need to go back to school and take all the vet school requirements. Furthermore, it is generally advantageous to have varied animal/industry experience, not just all small animal clinical experience. Do you know how many vet school applicants are small animal clinical vet techs/assistants? Like, almost all of them. It's very hard to differentiate yourself when you're an Animal Science major and working as a small animal vet tech/assistant like 90% of the applicants. Vet schools like to see people with experience in large/farm animal, exotics, lab animal, wildlife, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if you are happy with the idea of being a CVT as a career, and applying for vet school is more of a shot in the dark, it's a fine strategy. But if you're pretty focused/set on getting into vet school, there's better ways to spend your time and money to maximize your chances of getting in.|You probably won't like this answer, but it is quite difficult to become great at radiographs without active guidance. There's the adage of needing 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something, but what's usually lost from that concept is that it's 10,000 hours of \\*\\*guided\\*\\* practice. That is, being supervised by a teacher, trainer, coach, etc. to correct your mistakes and reinforce your successes. Without the guidance, you are very likely just reinforcing your bad habits. I have met many GPs and ER vets with years of experience who \\*think\\* they are good at rads, but in reality are probably worse than an average vet student who just finished their radiology rotation. To take it a step further, even radiologists who are working solo and/or teleradiology exclusive and therefore very rarely getting second opinions on their reads or followup from surgeons and pathologists also end up reinforcing bad habits. Without surgeons and pathologists to keep us honest, we may as well believe we have a 100% accuracy rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the hardest part about learning to read radiographs is being able to differentiate normal from abnormal. This is a lot harder than it sounds, because there is a very wide range of \"normal\" and it overlaps with a lot of \"abnormal.\" And what I mean by normal is \"no clinically significant abnormalities\", which is different from \"textbook normal.\" A prime example of this is abdominal radiographs on a patient with acute vomiting and diarrhea. Most of the time, I read these out as normal abdomen. The intern or ER doc may then come and ask, so these don't look like gastroenteritis? To which I ask, what are the radiographic signs of gastroenteritis? And they don't answer, because of course there aren't really any specific radiographic signs of gastroenteritis. I may see some things that I associate more often with gastroenteritis — fragmented gas pattern in the jejunum, diffuse gas dilation of the GI tract, etc. — and if the clinical history fits I may conclude acute gastroenteritis so the ordering clinician feels better about their workup. But in reality, those radiographic signs are pretty common in animals with no GI symptoms at all, so it wouldn't be wrong to just conclude \"normal abdomen.\" The goal of abdominal rads in the acutely vomiting animal is not to rule \\*\\*in\\*\\* gastroenteritis, it is to rule \\*\\*out\\*\\* mechanical obstruction, radiopaque foreign material, or other gross abnormalities like abdominal mass effect or ascites. \"Normal abdomen\" effectively rules those things out, leaving you with a provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis so long as the remainder of the clinical picture fits (i.e., not in acute renal failure, liver failure, Addisonian crisis, etc.). \n",
      "\n",
      "So ultimately this is where reading textbooks like Thrall is useful, even if the example images aren't amazing. You learn what the actual radiographic signs are that are classically associated with disease processes. There isn't really a better overall textbook out there than Thrall. For thorax specifically though, I like the BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Thoracic Imaging: [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/BSAVA+Manual+of+Canine+and+Feline+Thoracic+Imaging-p-9780905214979](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/bsava+manual+of+canine+and+feline+thoracic+imaging-p-9780905214979) It's a little bit dated (published 2008) but it's not like there have been major advances in thoracic radiography since then. The BSAVA abdomen and MSK books are decent, but not as good as the thorax one.\n",

      "This is also a great online atlas: [https://www.imaios.com/en/vet-anatomy](https://www.imaios.com/en/vet-anatomy) although it's mainly for CT/MRI. There is one section for dog MSK rads, which I think is still useful. This is BY FAR my most used reference in day to day work, but I don't know how useful it is to a non-radiologist. It is $95/year as a subscription, but the dog MSK rads (and also the dog CT head) atlases are free.\n",

I've never even owned a dog.|With the understanding that this Reddit post is not a job ad, biggest immediate red flag is “competitive wage.” Everyone says that, I’ve never seen any job ad that declares their salary not to be competitive. There’s a shortage of vets, and we’re inundated with recruiting emails. It’s not uncommon for us to simply delete/ignore any ads that don’t list an actual salary range. For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location. Including production, I would bet it’s not unusual for vets in OR to be making $180-200K. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is not to say you need to match that, given your circumstances, and you’d be surprised how many vets are willing to work for straight salary, but you probably still need to be able to pay $120-150K depending on experience. \n",

      "If you are a 501(c)(3) organization then new grads working for you should qualify for federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which is effectively a six figure bonus at the 10 year mark, paid for by the federal government. I would double check with your lawyer/accountant before making it a prominent part of your recruiting. \n",

      "I would probably focus a lot of your recruiting at Oregon State, on the assumption there is some population of students there who are from Oregon, want to remain in Oregon, and are paying in-state tuition so they have a slightly lower loan burden. Those vet students also are less likely to be weighing offers from low cost of living areas like Oklahoma or Tennessee where $120K goes a lot farther. \n",
      "\n",
      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations. A good nonprofit has to be run like a normal for-profit hospital, and then there has to be great fundraising and establishment of trust and engagement with the community. Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org. And of course the Animal Medical Center in NYC and Angell in Boston are two of the largest and oldest specialty hospitals in the country, both also 501(c)(3) orgs.|I am not sure about Australia, but in the US most interventional radiologists are actually not radiologists. Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that. I don't know the pathology dept at NCSU specifically, but most pathology depts are usually pretty welcoming to any students who show real interest in pathology.|You need to put actual numbers in your job ads as a bare minimum to get any interest.

They are generally customized for an individual resident, and the \"alternative\" aspect is usually that the supervising radiologists will be spread out over 2 or more institutions rather than all in one location. There is still a requirement that a residency director be on location at the primary hospital for at least 50% of the time, and at least one other supervising radiologist (but typically more than one) be available for immediate live clinical consultation/interaction the rest of the time (usually meaning the resident goes to a different hospital with a radiologist, or the other radiologist is a contracted locum at the primary hospital, but technically could also be a virtual locum on a Zoom call all day). \n",

There is still a requirement of at least 2 boarded radiologists to establish an alternative track residency, so if you are restricted in not being able to leave your geographic area, there needs to be two radiologists within your radius who agree to take on this task of training you.|What niche branch/specialty are you talking about? It likely varies to some degree from specialty to specialty.\n",

Realistically, in order to lose a case like that, you'd have to have a radiologist willing to testify that your miss was a major error that affected the outcome of the case and that a general practitioner should be expected to identify. Any doctor, radiologist or not, who claims that loss of serosal detail in the right cranial quadrant is a sure sign of pancreatitis that shouldn't be missed is full of shit. As a radiologist, I am well aware of all the classical radiographic signs of pancreatitis, and anecdotally based on followup abdominal ultrasounds in these cases I can confidently say the classical signs of pancreatitis on radiographs are both poorly sensitive and poorly specific.

I still wouldn't be overly concerned about being sued, as your error would have to be pretty egregious for a radiologist to testify that you should be penalized for it, but as a matter of basic medical standard and patient care you should maybe be concerned.

      "Vet med is not a good field to go into for \"lucrative.\" In a vacuum it is, as most new graduates are now making in the $110K-150K range. But most new graduates also have between $150-400K in student loans, so their overall financial situation is not great. Veterinarians are also (I think) the lowest paid of the doctoral-level healthcare professionals (human physicians, dentists, pharmacists, etc.). I believe the average vet also makes similar or less than the average nurse practitioner or physician assistant, which require fewer years of training and therefore lower educational cost. \n",
      "\n",
      "Being an emergency veterinarian can be quite lucrative, especially if you work in a relatively high-cost urban or suburban area, likely averaging in the $200-250K range. And being a board-certified specialist also can be quite lucrative, likely in the $250-350K range. But that also requires at minimum an additional 4 years of post-graduate training, at very low salary. And equivalent-level MD specialists will still make around twice as much as the veterinary specialist (i.e., while a veterinary surgeon may make $350-400K, an MD surgeon will make $700-800K).|I am not a surgeon (I am a radiologist) but I will take a stab at some of your questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Applicants who have years of experience in lieu of a rotating internship are generally at a disadvantage. The key is what the nature of your experience is. If you're working for 3 years as an ER vet in a referral hospital with all the standard specialties that one would have at a rotating internship, that is good experience. If you're working for 2 years in a general practice with minimal to no direct exposure to (boarded) specialists, that's bad experience. \n",
      "2. An internship recognized by EBVS is *probably* valid, but I would guess it is viewed as second tier unless it is well enough known as to be internationally reputable.\n",
      "3. Recs from vets in the UK would hold weight, so long as the vets are boarded specialists. DACVS probably holds more weight than DECVS, but only by a little.\n",
      "4. I have no idea how you would get involved in publishing something at a private clinic. It really just depends on whether you have contact with a boarded specialist who is willing to co-author the paper with you.\n",
      "5. The surgery diploma may help a little bit, but not much. Any ACVS residency is likely to be quite skeptical of the diploma/certificate, since they don't really know how rigorous the criteria are for passing. It would likely simply be viewed as \"candidate demonstrates an interest in small animal surgery.\"\n",
      "6. GPA comparison is very challenging unless the residency happens to have a faculty surgeon who is familiar with your school. If a class rank is available and can be shared as part of your application, that may hold more weight than straight GPA.\n",
      "7. They won't skip over your application without ECFVG/NAVLE, but you are likely at some kind of disadvantage without it. Also note that without ECFVG/NAVLE, even if you pass your boards you would be restricted to working at a university teaching hospital in the US.\n",
      "8. The most important part of the residency application is your references. Ideally, if you can find a surgeon (or two) who are double boarded in ACVS and ECVS to write letters, that's the best thing you can do. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the thing that residencies want to know is whether you will pass your boards and whether you will be a functional part of a surgery department for the 3 years of residency. The best way for them to know this is by having references from DACVS vets who know the candidate well and can vouch for their ability to survive a residency. This is the reason why DACVS references are preferred – they have been through the residency and passed the ACVS boards. DECVS may be perfectly knowledgeable and skilled surgeons, but they have not gone through an ACVS residency and passed those boards. There is an assumption that the two are probably close enough that a DECVS can evaluate whether a candidate is residency material, but again, if you have no DACVS references you are likely at a disadvantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the internship vs experience and the utility of the 1 year surgery diploma/certificate, ultimately the problem is that this is \"nontraditional\" for a candidate for an ACVS residency. There are many, many qualified applicants with a more traditional education/training background, many more than the number of residency spots. Last year, there were 238 applicants for 54 spots, with a match rate of 22.27%. More than 4 applicants for every 1 spot. And the vast majority of those applicants went to an AVMA-Accredited school, did a rotating internship in the US or Canada, and the vast majority of successful applicants also have one or more surgical internships as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "ACVS residencies have decided that this background – good grades at accredited school, rotating internship, surgical internship, multiple good DACVS references – is a good predictor of success for a resident. And there are more applicants who fit this profile than there are residency spots. So for you to supplant one of those candidates as a Spanish vet school grad, with no rotating internship, no surgical internship, and no DACVS references, you basically have to be a total rock star of a surgery candidate, and your DECVS references will need to say so emphatically.|\"Recognized\" is a nebulous word. Because vet med is minimally regulated in the US, anybody can do anything once they have a license. There are plenty of self-styled orthopedic \"specialists\" who have never been through a residency and are certainly not board-certified surgeons. But are boarded European specialists generally considered equivalent to the American specialist counterparts? Yes. At least in radiology, for example, a DECVDI is counted as a DACVR equivalent for the purpose of ACVR residency accreditation. Mind you, we are talking about boarded specialists here, not the Advanced Practitioner certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "To work as a vet in the US, you either have to have passed your NAVLE, or you have to work under the umbrella license of a university teaching hospital. This applies to boarded specialists as well. Having a DECVS or DECVDI does not allow you to bypass the need for a valid medical license. So if you are a DECVS who has not passed the NAVLE (either directly or after having gone through ECFVG or PAVE certification first), your only option is to work at a university. That said, there are many such European specialists working at universities, because academia pays like crap so it's hard to attract and retain faculty. \n",

      "I think that if your general vet med education is still fresh in your mind, and your plan (being a US citizen) is to live/work in the US permanently, it would be advisable to go through the ECFVG. Even with the cost, you will make a LOT more money if you have the ability to work in private practice, whether as a GP, an ER vet, or a specialist.|As many have already noted, the salary is pretty low. $125K is the mean starting salary for 2023 new graduates in private practice.

      "Beyond that, though, what is the clinic organization and working conditions? 20% ownership at signing and \"can change the name to whatever they want\" suggests this new employee has immediate full control of the practice itself. To me this sounds like there's one vet who owns the clinic is looking to retire, allowing the new vet to rename/rebrand however they like. Most people these days are looking to work in a larger team environment, as opposed to being effectively a solo practitioner. This also begs the question of how many support staff are there for the X number of vets? Especially how many RVTs, how many VAs, how many kennel attendants, how many receptionists, and is there a practice manager?|There are no reliable data, that I'm aware of. And salaries across the board in vet med have changed drastically since the pandemic, so any data you find from 2020 or earlier is likely so outdated as to be totally useless at this point.

      "\n",
      "Generally speaking, cardiologists are in high demand and make a lot of money. Especially if you decide to work as a mobile practitioner, and even more so if you learn basic abdominal ultrasound and add that to your mobile services. As a basic rule of thumb, simply by being in a major clinical specialty, you probably will be making $250K at bare minimum. I would guess the average cardiologist makes around $350K, and I personally know cardiologists making over $400K, which is probably mid-upper range for private practice. I would not be surprised if mobile cardiologists are making $500K+. This is all wild speculation, though.\n",

And then ideally wherever you do an internship there will also be many additional specialists.|Yes, basically any larger referral hospital or teaching hospital with a radiology department (i.e., has radiologists on staff) will have full time techs working in the radiology department. Veterinary radiology tech backgrounds run the gamut: vet assistants who are trained on-the-job to acquire imaging studies, registered vet techs (RVT) who are trained on-the-job and who may progress to vet tech specialization (VTS, involves benchmarks for experience and then passing a certifying exam), human medical radiologic technologists (RT) who shift to vet med part time or full time, human medical registered diagnostic medical sonographers (RDMS) who shift to vet med part time or full time. \n",

I graduated from college in the late 90s, had several family members who were MDs including my father and a couple of my older cousins. So I kind of knew where medicine was headed, and I also really disliked the pre-med students in college, and didn't want to spend my life calling them my colleagues. One of my friends was pre-vet, and she was pretty cool, so I switched sides (took a couple years off after college to pursue other random things but eventually settled on vet school).|Starting salary for a small animal private practice GP is about $130k right now, so the simple math says yes, the two additional years of working salary is worth the higher tuition.|That starts getting complicated. So if we assume 10% interest rate (which is higher than it is right now, I think), over 7 years you accrue $106k on a $270k loan, bringing you up to $376k when you finish in the US. On a $400k loan over 5 years at 10%, you accrue $109k in interest, putting you at $509k when you finish in the UK. That's a difference of $133k. In order for you to bridge that gap in the two years of working, you'd need to put in somewhere around $6k per month towards your loans.\n",

      "There's a lot of variables, though, which can result in a significant change in the calculation. Obviously, the real cost of attendance is a big one, so if real cost of attendance in the UK is lower than you estimate, or the cost in the US is higher than you estimate, that will be a big change. Also whatever is that actual interest rate you get will make a big difference.

For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location.

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that. I don't know the pathology dept at NCSU specifically, but most pathology depts are usually pretty welcoming to any students who show real interest in pathology.|You need to put actual numbers in your job ads as a bare minimum to get any interest.

And that's for a new graduate, so if you're serious about \"commensurate with experience\" then it should be higher than that for an experienced vet.|That is not unusual in the highest cost of living areas like Daly City (Bay Area) or NYC. In the same way that people in the lowest cost of living parts of the country like Oklahoma are getting offers with base salary in the $70-80K range which is 30% below average (despite cost of living only being 13% lower than national average). Veterinarians devaluing ourselves is definitely part of the problem that perpetuates our low pay relative other equivalently trained healthcare professionals.|Yes, most vets have free time, families, pets, and a life outside of work. It depends of course on what branch of vet med you go into, and to some degree your own job selection (some people are just workaholics), but if when you say \"one of my parents works in human medicine\" you mean that they are a physician or work a physician's schedule, then you probably have a good idea of the time commitment. An average small animal clinical vet might have a schedule that looks like 4 weekday 10 hour shifts, a rotating weekend schedule that might be one Saturday per month, and likely 3-4 weeks vacation per year. Many vets end up having to spend extra time after their shift end to finish paperwork and do some client callbacks, so on average 40-50 hours per week actually working plus their weekend rotation. \n",
      "\n",
      "And as I said, there's a very wide range depending on what area of vet med you go into. Some people might be ER vets, pulling 12-14 hour shifts for 3 days in row then have like a week off.

It won't be a big difference, though, because they don't want to discourage radiologists from living in time zones with reduced coverage (most of their radiologists will be in the North American and Western European time zones, so coverage in Asia/Australia tends to be poor).|I don't know any veterinary or human radiologists who are concerned about AI taking our jobs in our lifetime. Perhaps we are all collectively delusional, but I doubt it.

There were two students in my class in their 50s, and several in their 30s and 40s. Really the biggest question is financial. If you’ve made enough money in your career up to now that you can fund the educational path without loans, you are good to go. If you need to take out major loans, then you’ll have to do some number crunching to figure out if you can make it work. Figure you’ll need 2-3 years to complete your academic and veterinary experience prerequisites, then 4 years of school means you’ll be in your mid-40s when you graduate. Tuition for 4 years will be $200-300K (depending on if you get into your in-state school). Most people need to budget another $100-150K for living expenses, but presumably your calculation will be different depending on your personal situation (Own your own home?

Many vets these days have trouble paying off their loans in 20-25 years and may go for an income-based repayment plan (in which the balance of your loans are forgiven after 20 or 25 years).

So you will need to demonstrate that you have a plan in place for how to grow the business/caseload to make it worthwhile. You will likely need to hire at least one additional tech (CVT ideally) and likely also at least one additional vet assistant. You should ensure your business plan can accommodate the new hires, and be prepared to include it in the contract with the new vet.\n",

On average, most specialists (we are talking common clinical small animal specialties working in private practice) will make 2-3x the average GP and probably 1.5-2x the average ER (non-boarded) vet.

Most radiologists I know are working at least part time teleradiology and making about $400-500K for 40 hours/week. Those working full time teleradiology are making that amount for about 30 hours/week (and no commute). Those working full time in-house practice are making less, maybe $300-350K for 40-50 hours. Not bad at all, but comparable to other clinical specialties as opposed to absurd teleradiology bubble salary. One big advantage of radiology, of course, is that due to the lack of client contact and no need for referral letters, callbacks, sitting around talking about cases, and other such \"non-revenue generating\" activities, almost all the hours worked are productive.|According to the VIRMP site:\n",
      "\n",
      ">Commitment Process:  \n",
      "One of the most important aspects of participation in the VIRMP is the early commitment which is made by the applicant; that is, the applicant must agree to accept a position at any of the institutions or private practices which he/she ranked. When creating an account, the applicant will electronically sign an agreement to this effect. Failure to comply will result in sanctions including a ban from participation in the VIRMP for at least 3 years. This agreement must be completed online no later than February 16, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the deadline to withdraw has already passed. The match is not a traditional job offer/acceptance situation. When you signed the electronic commitment, that was your acceptance of whatever \"job offer\" is assigned to you by the match program. You have already accepted any potential job offer from all the internship programs you decided to apply for. You are already past the point of having the option to reject an internship \"offer\" without penalty.|There's no specific timeline after the match. Essentially, at some point in the days/weeks after the match, your internship institution should contact you and provide information regarding starting dates, orientation schedule, state licensing info (if needed), and to request any personal information they need for employment/HR purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are going to reject the internship, out of professional courtesy you should do that ASAP when you get your match result. You will still be penalized by the VIRMP with the 3 year freeze, and you likely will go on a Do Not Hire list at the institution, but you at least give the institution the opportunity to scramble and find a replacement for the internship spot you are vacating. \n",
      "\n",
      "You should probably be aware also that even after the 3 year VIRMP freeze, you would be seriously damaging your chances of ever matching in the future. Vet Med is a surprisingly small world, and many people (especially in academia) are well connected. Your decision to reject an internship after the match will reflect poorly on the faculty who wrote your reference letters, and they will almost certainly not agree to write you another letter if you decide to reapply in the future. Chances are none of your other current faculty would be comfortable writing a letter for you after a 3 year hiatus (especially knowing the reason for the hiatus). So during those three years you would need to establish new positive working relationships, ideally with boarded specialists, who would write your reference letters and directly address your previous actions. Even then, many internship programs would likely view your application with a very big red flag, unless there was an extenuating circumstance like an immediate family member fell ill and you had to pause/upend your career path in order to take care of them.|If you have the time and money to spend on training to be a CVT, it's fine. But don't approach it like a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a vet. It would be like becoming a Registered Nurse as a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a Medical Doctor. Essentially, you should view it as a backup career option, which is not totally unreasonable as the acceptance rate for vet school is like 8-12%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that although there is overlap in knowledge between the two careers, most of the classes you take aren't applicable to vet school pre-reqs (as far as I'm aware). So after you got your CVT, you would then need to go back to school and take all the vet school requirements. Furthermore, it is generally advantageous to have varied animal/industry experience, not just all small animal clinical experience. Do you know how many vet school applicants are small animal clinical vet techs/assistants? Like, almost all of them. It's very hard to differentiate yourself when you're an Animal Science major and working as a small animal vet tech/assistant like 90% of the applicants. Vet schools like to see people with experience in large/farm animal, exotics, lab animal, wildlife, etc. \n",

There's the adage of needing 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something, but what's usually lost from that concept is that it's 10,000 hours of \\*\\*guided\\*\\* practice. That is, being supervised by a teacher, trainer, coach, etc. to correct your mistakes and reinforce your successes. Without the guidance, you are very likely just reinforcing your bad habits. I have met many GPs and ER vets with years of experience who \\*think\\* they are good at rads, but in reality are probably worse than an average vet student who just finished their radiology rotation. To take it a step further, even radiologists who are working solo and/or teleradiology exclusive and therefore very rarely getting second opinions on their reads or followup from surgeons and pathologists also end up reinforcing bad habits. Without surgeons and pathologists to keep us honest, we may as well believe we have a 100% accuracy rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the hardest part about learning to read radiographs is being able to differentiate normal from abnormal. This is a lot harder than it sounds, because there is a very wide range of \"normal\" and it overlaps with a lot of \"abnormal.\" And what I mean by normal is \"no clinically significant abnormalities\", which is different from \"textbook normal.\" A prime example of this is abdominal radiographs on a patient with acute vomiting and diarrhea. Most of the time, I read these out as normal abdomen. The intern or ER doc may then come and ask, so these don't look like gastroenteritis? To which I ask, what are the radiographic signs of gastroenteritis? And they don't answer, because of course there aren't really any specific radiographic signs of gastroenteritis. I may see some things that I associate more often with gastroenteritis — fragmented gas pattern in the jejunum, diffuse gas dilation of the GI tract, etc. — and if the clinical history fits I may conclude acute gastroenteritis so the ordering clinician feels better about their workup. But in reality, those radiographic signs are pretty common in animals with no GI symptoms at all, so it wouldn't be wrong to just conclude \"normal abdomen.\" The goal of abdominal rads in the acutely vomiting animal is not to rule \\*\\*in\\*\\* gastroenteritis, it is to rule \\*\\*out\\*\\* mechanical obstruction, radiopaque foreign material, or other gross abnormalities like abdominal mass effect or ascites. \"Normal abdomen\" effectively rules those things out, leaving you with a provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis so long as the remainder of the clinical picture fits (i.e., not in acute renal failure, liver failure, Addisonian crisis, etc.). \n",
      "\n",
      "So ultimately this is where reading textbooks like Thrall is useful, even if the example images aren't amazing. You learn what the actual radiographic signs are that are classically associated with disease processes. There isn't really a better overall textbook out there than Thrall.

There’s a shortage of vets, and we’re inundated with recruiting emails. It’s not uncommon for us to simply delete/ignore any ads that don’t list an actual salary range. For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location. Including production, I would bet it’s not unusual for vets in OR to be making $180-200K. \n",

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices.

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that.

They are generally customized for an individual resident, and the \"alternative\" aspect is usually that the supervising radiologists will be spread out over 2 or more institutions rather than all in one location. There is still a requirement that a residency director be on location at the primary hospital for at least 50% of the time, and at least one other supervising radiologist (but typically more than one) be available for immediate live clinical consultation/interaction the rest of the time (usually meaning the resident goes to a different hospital with a radiologist, or the other radiologist is a contracted locum at the primary hospital, but technically could also be a virtual locum on a Zoom call all day). \n",

Realistically, in order to lose a case like that, you'd have to have a radiologist willing to testify that your miss was a major error that affected the outcome of the case and that a general practitioner should be expected to identify. Any doctor, radiologist or not, who claims that loss of serosal detail in the right cranial quadrant is a sure sign of pancreatitis that shouldn't be missed is full of shit. As a radiologist, I am well aware of all the classical radiographic signs of pancreatitis, and anecdotally based on followup abdominal ultrasounds in these cases I can confidently say the classical signs of pancreatitis on radiographs are both poorly sensitive and poorly specific.

I still wouldn't be overly concerned about being sued, as your error would have to be pretty egregious for a radiologist to testify that you should be penalized for it, but as a matter of basic medical standard and patient care you should maybe be concerned.

      "That is certainly a strategy you can take. Most radiologists are averse to negative explores, as that is pretty invasive. The \"old school\" approach was that if don't have a negative explore now and then, you're probably not doing enough surgeries. I think the more modern mindset is that every negative explore is a diagnostic failure. Cost of further diagnostics is certainly a consideration for our clients compared to human med, but if you had a complaint of vomiting and abdominal pain and went to the ER, and their initial imaging screening was inconclusive, I would bet you wouldn't seriously consider letting them do a diagnostic laparotomy on you in lieu of further imaging. I think so long as the pet owners understand that there are other noninvasive but perhaps less timely and more costly options available, and they are giving well informed consent to the exploratory, that's fine.|Challenging is very subjective and individual. I am a terrible surgeon, and so I would find being a surgeon quite challenging. I am also not very good at dealing with crashing patients and highly complex critical cases, so I would find ECC quite challenging. But some people are quite good at surgery and ECC, choose those for their careers, and probably don't feel overly challenged by their work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vet med is not a good field to go into for \"lucrative.\" In a vacuum it is, as most new graduates are now making in the $110K-150K range. But most new graduates also have between $150-400K in student loans, so their overall financial situation is not great. Veterinarians are also (I think) the lowest paid of the doctoral-level healthcare professionals (human physicians, dentists, pharmacists, etc.). I believe the average vet also makes similar or less than the average nurse practitioner or physician assistant, which require fewer years of training and therefore lower educational cost. \n",
      "\n",
      "Being an emergency veterinarian can be quite lucrative, especially if you work in a relatively high-cost urban or suburban area, likely averaging in the $200-250K range. And being a board-certified specialist also can be quite lucrative, likely in the $250-350K range. But that also requires at minimum an additional 4 years of post-graduate training, at very low salary. And equivalent-level MD specialists will still make around twice as much as the veterinary specialist (i.e., while a veterinary surgeon may make $350-400K, an MD surgeon will make $700-800K).|I am not a surgeon (I am a radiologist) but I will take a stab at some of your questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Applicants who have years of experience in lieu of a rotating internship are generally at a disadvantage. The key is what the nature of your experience is. If you're working for 3 years as an ER vet in a referral hospital with all the standard specialties that one would have at a rotating internship, that is good experience. If you're working for 2 years in a general practice with minimal to no direct exposure to (boarded) specialists, that's bad experience. \n",
      "2. An internship recognized by EBVS is *probably* valid, but I would guess it is viewed as second tier unless it is well enough known as to be internationally reputable.\n",
      "3. Recs from vets in the UK would hold weight, so long as the vets are boarded specialists. DACVS probably holds more weight than DECVS, but only by a little.\n",
      "4. I have no idea how you would get involved in publishing something at a private clinic. It really just depends on whether you have contact with a boarded specialist who is willing to co-author the paper with you.\n",
      "5. The surgery diploma may help a little bit, but not much. Any ACVS residency is likely to be quite skeptical of the diploma/certificate, since they don't really know how rigorous the criteria are for passing. It would likely simply be viewed as \"candidate demonstrates an interest in small animal surgery.\"\n",
      "6. GPA comparison is very challenging unless the residency happens to have a faculty surgeon who is familiar with your school. If a class rank is available and can be shared as part of your application, that may hold more weight than straight GPA.\n",
      "7. They won't skip over your application without ECFVG/NAVLE, but you are likely at some kind of disadvantage without it. Also note that without ECFVG/NAVLE, even if you pass your boards you would be restricted to working at a university teaching hospital in the US.\n",
      "8. The most important part of the residency application is your references. Ideally, if you can find a surgeon (or two) who are double boarded in ACVS and ECVS to write letters, that's the best thing you can do. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the thing that residencies want to know is whether you will pass your boards and whether you will be a functional part of a surgery department for the 3 years of residency. The best way for them to know this is by having references from DACVS vets who know the candidate well and can vouch for their ability to survive a residency. This is the reason why DACVS references are preferred – they have been through the residency and passed the ACVS boards. DECVS may be perfectly knowledgeable and skilled surgeons, but they have not gone through an ACVS residency and passed those boards. There is an assumption that the two are probably close enough that a DECVS can evaluate whether a candidate is residency material, but again, if you have no DACVS references you are likely at a disadvantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the internship vs experience and the utility of the 1 year surgery diploma/certificate, ultimately the problem is that this is \"nontraditional\" for a candidate for an ACVS residency. There are many, many qualified applicants with a more traditional education/training background, many more than the number of residency spots. Last year, there were 238 applicants for 54 spots, with a match rate of 22.27%. More than 4 applicants for every 1 spot. And the vast majority of those applicants went to an AVMA-Accredited school, did a rotating internship in the US or Canada, and the vast majority of successful applicants also have one or more surgical internships as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "ACVS residencies have decided that this background – good grades at accredited school, rotating internship, surgical internship, multiple good DACVS references – is a good predictor of success for a resident. And there are more applicants who fit this profile than there are residency spots. So for you to supplant one of those candidates as a Spanish vet school grad, with no rotating internship, no surgical internship, and no DACVS references, you basically have to be a total rock star of a surgery candidate, and your DECVS references will need to say so emphatically.|\"Recognized\" is a nebulous word. Because vet med is minimally regulated in the US, anybody can do anything once they have a license. There are plenty of self-styled orthopedic \"specialists\" who have never been through a residency and are certainly not board-certified surgeons. But are boarded European specialists generally considered equivalent to the American specialist counterparts? Yes. At least in radiology, for example, a DECVDI is counted as a DACVR equivalent for the purpose of ACVR residency accreditation. Mind you, we are talking about boarded specialists here, not the Advanced Practitioner certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "To work as a vet in the US, you either have to have passed your NAVLE, or you have to work under the umbrella license of a university teaching hospital. This applies to boarded specialists as well. Having a DECVS or DECVDI does not allow you to bypass the need for a valid medical license. So if you are a DECVS who has not passed the NAVLE (either directly or after having gone through ECFVG or PAVE certification first), your only option is to work at a university. That said, there are many such European specialists working at universities, because academia pays like crap so it's hard to attract and retain faculty. \n",

      "I think that if your general vet med education is still fresh in your mind, and your plan (being a US citizen) is to live/work in the US permanently, it would be advisable to go through the ECFVG. Even with the cost, you will make a LOT more money if you have the ability to work in private practice, whether as a GP, an ER vet, or a specialist.|As many have already noted, the salary is pretty low. $125K is the mean starting salary for 2023 new graduates in private practice. Mean/average salary, meaning a very significant number of new grads are making more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond that, though, what is the clinic organization and working conditions? 20% ownership at signing and \"can change the name to whatever they want\" suggests this new employee has immediate full control of the practice itself. To me this sounds like there's one vet who owns the clinic is looking to retire, allowing the new vet to rename/rebrand however they like. Most people these days are looking to work in a larger team environment, as opposed to being effectively a solo practitioner. This also begs the question of how many support staff are there for the X number of vets? Especially how many RVTs, how many VAs, how many kennel attendants, how many receptionists, and is there a practice manager?|There are no reliable data, that I'm aware of. And salaries across the board in vet med have changed drastically since the pandemic, so any data you find from 2020 or earlier is likely so outdated as to be totally useless at this point. There may be internal data within the cardiology college (ACVIM) but I am not privy to it if so. \n",
      "\n",
      "Generally speaking, cardiologists are in high demand and make a lot of money. Especially if you decide to work as a mobile practitioner, and even more so if you learn basic abdominal ultrasound and add that to your mobile services. As a basic rule of thumb, simply by being in a major clinical specialty, you probably will be making $250K at bare minimum. I would guess the average cardiologist makes around $350K, and I personally know cardiologists making over $400K, which is probably mid-upper range for private practice. I would not be surprised if mobile cardiologists are making $500K+. This is all wild speculation, though.\n",

And then ideally wherever you do an internship there will also be many additional specialists.|Yes, basically any larger referral hospital or teaching hospital with a radiology department (i.e., has radiologists on staff) will have full time techs working in the radiology department. Veterinary radiology tech backgrounds run the gamut: vet assistants who are trained on-the-job to acquire imaging studies, registered vet techs (RVT) who are trained on-the-job and who may progress to vet tech specialization (VTS, involves benchmarks for experience and then passing a certifying exam), human medical radiologic technologists (RT) who shift to vet med part time or full time, human medical registered diagnostic medical sonographers (RDMS) who shift to vet med part time or full time. \n",

I graduated from college in the late 90s, had several family members who were MDs including my father and a couple of my older cousins. So I kind of knew where medicine was headed, and I also really disliked the pre-med students in college, and didn't want to spend my life calling them my colleagues. One of my friends was pre-vet, and she was pretty cool, so I switched sides (took a couple years off after college to pursue other random things but eventually settled on vet school).|Starting salary for a small animal private practice GP is about $130k right now, so the simple math says yes, the two additional years of working salary is worth the higher tuition.|That starts getting complicated. So if we assume 10% interest rate (which is higher than it is right now, I think), over 7 years you accrue $106k on a $270k loan, bringing you up to $376k when you finish in the US. On a $400k loan over 5 years at 10%, you accrue $109k in interest, putting you at $509k when you finish in the UK. That's a difference of $133k. In order for you to bridge that gap in the two years of working, you'd need to put in somewhere around $6k per month towards your loans.\n",

      "There's a lot of variables, though, which can result in a significant change in the calculation. Obviously, the real cost of attendance is a big one, so if real cost of attendance in the UK is lower than you estimate, or the cost in the US is higher than you estimate, that will be a big change. Also whatever is that actual interest rate you get will make a big difference.

For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location.

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that. I don't know the pathology dept at NCSU specifically, but most pathology depts are usually pretty welcoming to any students who show real interest in pathology.|You need to put actual numbers in your job ads as a bare minimum to get any interest.

And that's for a new graduate, so if you're serious about \"commensurate with experience\" then it should be higher than that for an experienced vet.|That is not unusual in the highest cost of living areas like Daly City (Bay Area) or NYC. In the same way that people in the lowest cost of living parts of the country like Oklahoma are getting offers with base salary in the $70-80K range which is 30% below average (despite cost of living only being 13% lower than national average).

It depends of course on what branch of vet med you go into, and to some degree your own job selection (some people are just workaholics), but if when you say \"one of my parents works in human medicine\" you mean that they are a physician or work a physician's schedule, then you probably have a good idea of the time commitment. An average small animal clinical vet might have a schedule that looks like 4 weekday 10 hour shifts, a rotating weekend schedule that might be one Saturday per month, and likely 3-4 weeks vacation per year. Many vets end up having to spend extra time after their shift end to finish paperwork and do some client callbacks, so on average 40-50 hours per week actually working plus their weekend rotation. \n",
      "\n",
      "And as I said, there's a very wide range depending on what area of vet med you go into. Some people might be ER vets, pulling 12-14 hour shifts for 3 days in row then have like a week off.

Most of the large global teleradiology companies pay quite well (in the US most full-time teleradiologists will make in the range of $300-600K (USD) annually. I think most of the large global teleradiology companies (Antech, IDEXX, VetCT, etc.) might have a slight differential pay for their radiologists based on cost of living in their country of residence, but I am not totally sure about that. It won't be a big difference, though, because they don't want to discourage radiologists from living in time zones with reduced coverage (most of their radiologists will be in the North American and Western European time zones, so coverage in Asia/Australia tends to be poor).|I don't know any veterinary or human radiologists who are concerned about AI taking our jobs in our lifetime. Perhaps we are all collectively delusional, but I doubt it.

There were two students in my class in their 50s, and several in their 30s and 40s. Really the biggest question is financial. If you’ve made enough money in your career up to now that you can fund the educational path without loans, you are good to go. If you need to take out major loans, then you’ll have to do some number crunching to figure out if you can make it work. Figure you’ll need 2-3 years to complete your academic and veterinary experience prerequisites, then 4 years of school means you’ll be in your mid-40s when you graduate. Tuition for 4 years will be $200-300K (depending on if you get into your in-state school). Most people need to budget another $100-150K for living expenses, but presumably your calculation will be different depending on your personal situation (Own your own home?

Many vets these days have trouble paying off their loans in 20-25 years and may go for an income-based repayment plan (in which the balance of your loans are forgiven after 20 or 25 years).

      "Now, that's calculated from average base salary of $112K with anticipated production of $21K. You could get away with a base in the $110-115K range if you think you can reasonably demonstrate that the new associate can expect to produce an additional $20-30K on top of that, but that would put you at right about average for a new graduate from last year. Chances are the 2024 graduates will be a little higher. Also, that $133K number is the average for the whole country, meaning a good number of new grads are above that. If you're in a HCOL area, chances are prospective vets will be expecting more.\n",
      "\n",
      "You say you can't afford 120K+ \"without growing a bit\" but if you are going from 1 doctor to 2, you have no choice but to grow a bit. Even if your current owner is looking to go part-time into semi-retirement, a new associate is going to be expecting full time work, not just taking over the 0.5 or even 0.75 time that the current owner is scaling back. So you will need to demonstrate that you have a plan in place for how to grow the business/caseload to make it worthwhile. You will likely need to hire at least one additional tech (CVT ideally) and likely also at least one additional vet assistant. You should ensure your business plan can accommodate the new hires, and be prepared to include it in the contract with the new vet.\n",

On average, most specialists (we are talking common clinical small animal specialties working in private practice) will make 2-3x the average GP and probably 1.5-2x the average ER (non-boarded) vet. Whether that additional salary is worth the additional 4-6 years of training (along with the poverty wages and accruing interest on student loans) is a personal decision. \n",

      "For radiology specifically, I cannot imagine any specialty currently that makes more money *per hour worked* than radiology. Most radiologists I know are working at least part time teleradiology and making about $400-500K for 40 hours/week. Those working full time teleradiology are making that amount for about 30 hours/week (and no commute). Those working full time in-house practice are making less, maybe $300-350K for 40-50 hours. Not bad at all, but comparable to other clinical specialties as opposed to absurd teleradiology bubble salary. One big advantage of radiology, of course, is that due to the lack of client contact and no need for referral letters, callbacks, sitting around talking about cases, and other such \"non-revenue generating\" activities, almost all the hours worked are productive.|According to the VIRMP site:\n",
      "\n",
      ">Commitment Process:  \n",
      "One of the most important aspects of participation in the VIRMP is the early commitment which is made by the applicant; that is, the applicant must agree to accept a position at any of the institutions or private practices which he/she ranked. When creating an account, the applicant will electronically sign an agreement to this effect. Failure to comply will result in sanctions including a ban from participation in the VIRMP for at least 3 years. This agreement must be completed online no later than February 16, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the deadline to withdraw has already passed. The match is not a traditional job offer/acceptance situation. When you signed the electronic commitment, that was your acceptance of whatever \"job offer\" is assigned to you by the match program. You have already accepted any potential job offer from all the internship programs you decided to apply for. You are already past the point of having the option to reject an internship \"offer\" without penalty.|There's no specific timeline after the match. Essentially, at some point in the days/weeks after the match, your internship institution should contact you and provide information regarding starting dates, orientation schedule, state licensing info (if needed), and to request any personal information they need for employment/HR purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are going to reject the internship, out of professional courtesy you should do that ASAP when you get your match result. You will still be penalized by the VIRMP with the 3 year freeze, and you likely will go on a Do Not Hire list at the institution, but you at least give the institution the opportunity to scramble and find a replacement for the internship spot you are vacating. \n",
      "\n",
      "You should probably be aware also that even after the 3 year VIRMP freeze, you would be seriously damaging your chances of ever matching in the future. Vet Med is a surprisingly small world, and many people (especially in academia) are well connected. Your decision to reject an internship after the match will reflect poorly on the faculty who wrote your reference letters, and they will almost certainly not agree to write you another letter if you decide to reapply in the future. Chances are none of your other current faculty would be comfortable writing a letter for you after a 3 year hiatus (especially knowing the reason for the hiatus). So during those three years you would need to establish new positive working relationships, ideally with boarded specialists, who would write your reference letters and directly address your previous actions. Even then, many internship programs would likely view your application with a very big red flag, unless there was an extenuating circumstance like an immediate family member fell ill and you had to pause/upend your career path in order to take care of them.|If you have the time and money to spend on training to be a CVT, it's fine. But don't approach it like a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a vet. It would be like becoming a Registered Nurse as a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a Medical Doctor. Essentially, you should view it as a backup career option, which is not totally unreasonable as the acceptance rate for vet school is like 8-12%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that although there is overlap in knowledge between the two careers, most of the classes you take aren't applicable to vet school pre-reqs (as far as I'm aware). So after you got your CVT, you would then need to go back to school and take all the vet school requirements. Furthermore, it is generally advantageous to have varied animal/industry experience, not just all small animal clinical experience. Do you know how many vet school applicants are small animal clinical vet techs/assistants? Like, almost all of them. It's very hard to differentiate yourself when you're an Animal Science major and working as a small animal vet tech/assistant like 90% of the applicants. Vet schools like to see people with experience in large/farm animal, exotics, lab animal, wildlife, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if you are happy with the idea of being a CVT as a career, and applying for vet school is more of a shot in the dark, it's a fine strategy. But if you're pretty focused/set on getting into vet school, there's better ways to spend your time and money to maximize your chances of getting in.|You probably won't like this answer, but it is quite difficult to become great at radiographs without active guidance. There's the adage of needing 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something, but what's usually lost from that concept is that it's 10,000 hours of \\*\\*guided\\*\\* practice. That is, being supervised by a teacher, trainer, coach, etc. to correct your mistakes and reinforce your successes. Without the guidance, you are very likely just reinforcing your bad habits. I have met many GPs and ER vets with years of experience who \\*think\\* they are good at rads, but in reality are probably worse than an average vet student who just finished their radiology rotation. To take it a step further, even radiologists who are working solo and/or teleradiology exclusive and therefore very rarely getting second opinions on their reads or followup from surgeons and pathologists also end up reinforcing bad habits. Without surgeons and pathologists to keep us honest, we may as well believe we have a 100% accuracy rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the hardest part about learning to read radiographs is being able to differentiate normal from abnormal. This is a lot harder than it sounds, because there is a very wide range of \"normal\" and it overlaps with a lot of \"abnormal.\" And what I mean by normal is \"no clinically significant abnormalities\", which is different from \"textbook normal.\" A prime example of this is abdominal radiographs on a patient with acute vomiting and diarrhea. Most of the time, I read these out as normal abdomen. The intern or ER doc may then come and ask, so these don't look like gastroenteritis? To which I ask, what are the radiographic signs of gastroenteritis? And they don't answer, because of course there aren't really any specific radiographic signs of gastroenteritis. I may see some things that I associate more often with gastroenteritis — fragmented gas pattern in the jejunum, diffuse gas dilation of the GI tract, etc. — and if the clinical history fits I may conclude acute gastroenteritis so the ordering clinician feels better about their workup. But in reality, those radiographic signs are pretty common in animals with no GI symptoms at all, so it wouldn't be wrong to just conclude \"normal abdomen.\" The goal of abdominal rads in the acutely vomiting animal is not to rule \\*\\*in\\*\\* gastroenteritis, it is to rule \\*\\*out\\*\\* mechanical obstruction, radiopaque foreign material, or other gross abnormalities like abdominal mass effect or ascites. \"Normal abdomen\" effectively rules those things out, leaving you with a provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis so long as the remainder of the clinical picture fits (i.e., not in acute renal failure, liver failure, Addisonian crisis, etc.). \n",
      "\n",
      "So ultimately this is where reading textbooks like Thrall is useful, even if the example images aren't amazing. You learn what the actual radiographic signs are that are classically associated with disease processes. There isn't really a better overall textbook out there than Thrall. For thorax specifically though, I like the BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Thoracic Imaging: [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/BSAVA+Manual+of+Canine+and+Feline+Thoracic+Imaging-p-9780905214979](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/bsava+manual+of+canine+and+feline+thoracic+imaging-p-9780905214979) It's a little bit dated (published 2008) but it's not like there have been major advances in thoracic radiography since then. The BSAVA abdomen and MSK books are decent, but not as good as the thorax one.\n",

I've never even owned a dog.|With the understanding that this Reddit post is not a job ad, biggest immediate red flag is “competitive wage.” Everyone says that, I’ve never seen any job ad that declares their salary not to be competitive. There’s a shortage of vets, and we’re inundated with recruiting emails. It’s not uncommon for us to simply delete/ignore any ads that don’t list an actual salary range. For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location. Including production, I would bet it’s not unusual for vets in OR to be making $180-200K. \n",

      "If you are a 501(c)(3) organization then new grads working for you should qualify for federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which is effectively a six figure bonus at the 10 year mark, paid for by the federal government.

      "\n",
      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations. A good nonprofit has to be run like a normal for-profit hospital, and then there has to be great fundraising and establishment of trust and engagement with the community. Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org. And of course the Animal Medical Center in NYC and Angell in Boston are two of the largest and oldest specialty hospitals in the country, both also 501(c)(3) orgs.|I am not sure about Australia, but in the US most interventional radiologists are actually not radiologists. Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that. I don't know the pathology dept at NCSU specifically, but most pathology depts are usually pretty welcoming to any students who show real interest in pathology.|You need to put actual numbers in your job ads as a bare minimum to get any interest.

They are generally customized for an individual resident, and the \"alternative\" aspect is usually that the supervising radiologists will be spread out over 2 or more institutions rather than all in one location. There is still a requirement that a residency director be on location at the primary hospital for at least 50% of the time, and at least one other supervising radiologist (but typically more than one) be available for immediate live clinical consultation/interaction the rest of the time (usually meaning the resident goes to a different hospital with a radiologist, or the other radiologist is a contracted locum at the primary hospital, but technically could also be a virtual locum on a Zoom call all day). \n",

Realistically, in order to lose a case like that, you'd have to have a radiologist willing to testify that your miss was a major error that affected the outcome of the case and that a general practitioner should be expected to identify. Any doctor, radiologist or not, who claims that loss of serosal detail in the right cranial quadrant is a sure sign of pancreatitis that shouldn't be missed is full of shit. As a radiologist, I am well aware of all the classical radiographic signs of pancreatitis, and anecdotally based on followup abdominal ultrasounds in these cases I can confidently say the classical signs of pancreatitis on radiographs are both poorly sensitive and poorly specific.

I still wouldn't be overly concerned about being sued, as your error would have to be pretty egregious for a radiologist to testify that you should be penalized for it, but as a matter of basic medical standard and patient care you should maybe be concerned.

      "That is certainly a strategy you can take. Most radiologists are averse to negative explores, as that is pretty invasive. The \"old school\" approach was that if don't have a negative explore now and then, you're probably not doing enough surgeries. I think the more modern mindset is that every negative explore is a diagnostic failure. Cost of further diagnostics is certainly a consideration for our clients compared to human med, but if you had a complaint of vomiting and abdominal pain and went to the ER, and their initial imaging screening was inconclusive, I would bet you wouldn't seriously consider letting them do a diagnostic laparotomy on you in lieu of further imaging. I think so long as the pet owners understand that there are other noninvasive but perhaps less timely and more costly options available, and they are giving well informed consent to the exploratory, that's fine.|Challenging is very subjective and individual. I am a terrible surgeon, and so I would find being a surgeon quite challenging. I am also not very good at dealing with crashing patients and highly complex critical cases, so I would find ECC quite challenging. But some people are quite good at surgery and ECC, choose those for their careers, and probably don't feel overly challenged by their work.\n",

      "Vet med is not a good field to go into for \"lucrative.\" In a vacuum it is, as most new graduates are now making in the $110K-150K range. But most new graduates also have between $150-400K in student loans, so their overall financial situation is not great. Veterinarians are also (I think) the lowest paid of the doctoral-level healthcare professionals (human physicians, dentists, pharmacists, etc.). I believe the average vet also makes similar or less than the average nurse practitioner or physician assistant, which require fewer years of training and therefore lower educational cost. \n",

      "Being an emergency veterinarian can be quite lucrative, especially if you work in a relatively high-cost urban or suburban area, likely averaging in the $200-250K range. And being a board-certified specialist also can be quite lucrative, likely in the $250-350K range. But that also requires at minimum an additional 4 years of post-graduate training, at very low salary. And equivalent-level MD specialists will still make around twice as much as the veterinary specialist (i.e., while a veterinary surgeon may make $350-400K, an MD surgeon will make $700-800K).|I am not a surgeon (I am a radiologist) but I will take a stab at some of your questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Applicants who have years of experience in lieu of a rotating internship are generally at a disadvantage. The key is what the nature of your experience is. If you're working for 3 years as an ER vet in a referral hospital with all the standard specialties that one would have at a rotating internship, that is good experience. If you're working for 2 years in a general practice with minimal to no direct exposure to (boarded) specialists, that's bad experience. \n",
      "2. An internship recognized by EBVS is *probably* valid, but I would guess it is viewed as second tier unless it is well enough known as to be internationally reputable.\n",
      "3. Recs from vets in the UK would hold weight, so long as the vets are boarded specialists. DACVS probably holds more weight than DECVS, but only by a little.\n",
      "4. I have no idea how you would get involved in publishing something at a private clinic. It really just depends on whether you have contact with a boarded specialist who is willing to co-author the paper with you.\n",
      "5. The surgery diploma may help a little bit, but not much. Any ACVS residency is likely to be quite skeptical of the diploma/certificate, since they don't really know how rigorous the criteria are for passing. It would likely simply be viewed as \"candidate demonstrates an interest in small animal surgery.\"\n",
      "6. GPA comparison is very challenging unless the residency happens to have a faculty surgeon who is familiar with your school. If a class rank is available and can be shared as part of your application, that may hold more weight than straight GPA.\n",
      "7. They won't skip over your application without ECFVG/NAVLE, but you are likely at some kind of disadvantage without it. Also note that without ECFVG/NAVLE, even if you pass your boards you would be restricted to working at a university teaching hospital in the US.\n",
      "8. The most important part of the residency application is your references. Ideally, if you can find a surgeon (or two) who are double boarded in ACVS and ECVS to write letters, that's the best thing you can do. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the thing that residencies want to know is whether you will pass your boards and whether you will be a functional part of a surgery department for the 3 years of residency. The best way for them to know this is by having references from DACVS vets who know the candidate well and can vouch for their ability to survive a residency. This is the reason why DACVS references are preferred – they have been through the residency and passed the ACVS boards. DECVS may be perfectly knowledgeable and skilled surgeons, but they have not gone through an ACVS residency and passed those boards. There is an assumption that the two are probably close enough that a DECVS can evaluate whether a candidate is residency material, but again, if you have no DACVS references you are likely at a disadvantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the internship vs experience and the utility of the 1 year surgery diploma/certificate, ultimately the problem is that this is \"nontraditional\" for a candidate for an ACVS residency. There are many, many qualified applicants with a more traditional education/training background, many more than the number of residency spots. Last year, there were 238 applicants for 54 spots, with a match rate of 22.27%. More than 4 applicants for every 1 spot. And the vast majority of those applicants went to an AVMA-Accredited school, did a rotating internship in the US or Canada, and the vast majority of successful applicants also have one or more surgical internships as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "ACVS residencies have decided that this background – good grades at accredited school, rotating internship, surgical internship, multiple good DACVS references – is a good predictor of success for a resident. And there are more applicants who fit this profile than there are residency spots. So for you to supplant one of those candidates as a Spanish vet school grad, with no rotating internship, no surgical internship, and no DACVS references, you basically have to be a total rock star of a surgery candidate, and your DECVS references will need to say so emphatically.|\"Recognized\" is a nebulous word. Because vet med is minimally regulated in the US, anybody can do anything once they have a license. There are plenty of self-styled orthopedic \"specialists\" who have never been through a residency and are certainly not board-certified surgeons. But are boarded European specialists generally considered equivalent to the American specialist counterparts? Yes. At least in radiology, for example, a DECVDI is counted as a DACVR equivalent for the purpose of ACVR residency accreditation. Mind you, we are talking about boarded specialists here, not the Advanced Practitioner certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "To work as a vet in the US, you either have to have passed your NAVLE, or you have to work under the umbrella license of a university teaching hospital. This applies to boarded specialists as well. Having a DECVS or DECVDI does not allow you to bypass the need for a valid medical license. So if you are a DECVS who has not passed the NAVLE (either directly or after having gone through ECFVG or PAVE certification first), your only option is to work at a university. That said, there are many such European specialists working at universities, because academia pays like crap so it's hard to attract and retain faculty. \n",

      "Beyond that, though, what is the clinic organization and working conditions? 20% ownership at signing and \"can change the name to whatever they want\" suggests this new employee has immediate full control of the practice itself. To me this sounds like there's one vet who owns the clinic is looking to retire, allowing the new vet to rename/rebrand however they like. Most people these days are looking to work in a larger team environment, as opposed to being effectively a solo practitioner. This also begs the question of how many support staff are there for the X number of vets? Especially how many RVTs, how many VAs, how many kennel attendants, how many receptionists, and is there a practice manager?|There are no reliable data, that I'm aware of. And salaries across the board in vet med have changed drastically since the pandemic, so any data you find from 2020 or earlier is likely so outdated as to be totally useless at this point.

Especially if you decide to work as a mobile practitioner, and even more so if you learn basic abdominal ultrasound and add that to your mobile services.

I would guess the average cardiologist makes around $350K, and I personally know cardiologists making over $400K, which is probably mid-upper range for private practice. I would not be surprised if mobile cardiologists are making $500K+. This is all wild speculation, though.\n",

Veterinary radiology tech backgrounds run the gamut: vet assistants who are trained on-the-job to acquire imaging studies, registered vet techs (RVT) who are trained on-the-job and who may progress to vet tech specialization (VTS, involves benchmarks for experience and then passing a certifying exam), human medical radiologic technologists (RT) who shift to vet med part time or full time, human medical registered diagnostic medical sonographers (RDMS) who shift to vet med part time or full time. \n",

So if we assume 10% interest rate (which is higher than it is right now, I think), over 7 years you accrue $106k on a $270k loan, bringing you up to $376k when you finish in the US. On a $400k loan over 5 years at 10%, you accrue $109k in interest, putting you at $509k when you finish in the UK. That's a difference of $133k.

For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location.

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that. I don't know the pathology dept at NCSU specifically, but most pathology depts are usually pretty welcoming to any students who show real interest in pathology.|You need to put actual numbers in your job ads as a bare minimum to get any interest.

It depends of course on what branch of vet med you go into, and to some degree your own job selection (some people are just workaholics), but if when you say \"one of my parents works in human medicine\" you mean that they are a physician or work a physician's schedule, then you probably have a good idea of the time commitment. An average small animal clinical vet might have a schedule that looks like 4 weekday 10 hour shifts, a rotating weekend schedule that might be one Saturday per month, and likely 3-4 weeks vacation per year. Many vets end up having to spend extra time after their shift end to finish paperwork and do some client callbacks, so on average 40-50 hours per week actually working plus their weekend rotation. \n",
      "\n",
      "And as I said, there's a very wide range depending on what area of vet med you go into. Some people might be ER vets, pulling 12-14 hour shifts for 3 days in row then have like a week off.

There were two students in my class in their 50s, and several in their 30s and 40s. Really the biggest question is financial. If you’ve made enough money in your career up to now that you can fund the educational path without loans, you are good to go. If you need to take out major loans, then you’ll have to do some number crunching to figure out if you can make it work. Figure you’ll need 2-3 years to complete your academic and veterinary experience prerequisites, then 4 years of school means you’ll be in your mid-40s when you graduate. Tuition for 4 years will be $200-300K (depending on if you get into your in-state school).

That will be up a bit in 8 years (although tuition and living expenses may also be higher than the figures I listed). Many vets these days have trouble paying off their loans in 20-25 years and may go for an income-based repayment plan (in which the balance of your loans are forgiven after 20 or 25 years). So if at age 40 you are entering vet school in the same financial situation as the typical 22 year old student, you may end up spending your entire career as a vet paying off the loans.|The ones I remember were the Nextel phones. We had those in my internship, but that was almost 20 years ago, before smartphones were really a thing. Nextel is defunct now, I think. \n",

You could get away with a base in the $110-115K range if you think you can reasonably demonstrate that the new associate can expect to produce an additional $20-30K on top of that, but that would put you at right about average for a new graduate from last year. Chances are the 2024 graduates will be a little higher. Also, that $133K number is the average for the whole country, meaning a good number of new grads are above that. If you're in a HCOL area, chances are prospective vets will be expecting more.\n",

      "You say you can't afford 120K+ \"without growing a bit\" but if you are going from 1 doctor to 2, you have no choice but to grow a bit. Even if your current owner is looking to go part-time into semi-retirement, a new associate is going to be expecting full time work, not just taking over the 0.5 or even 0.75 time that the current owner is scaling back. So you will need to demonstrate that you have a plan in place for how to grow the business/caseload to make it worthwhile. You will likely need to hire at least one additional tech (CVT ideally) and likely also at least one additional vet assistant. You should ensure your business plan can accommodate the new hires, and be prepared to include it in the contract with the new vet.\n",

On average, most specialists (we are talking common clinical small animal specialties working in private practice) will make 2-3x the average GP and probably 1.5-2x the average ER (non-boarded) vet.

Most radiologists I know are working at least part time teleradiology and making about $400-500K for 40 hours/week. Those working full time teleradiology are making that amount for about 30 hours/week (and no commute). Those working full time in-house practice are making less, maybe $300-350K for 40-50 hours. Not bad at all, but comparable to other clinical specialties as opposed to absurd teleradiology bubble salary. One big advantage of radiology, of course, is that due to the lack of client contact and no need for referral letters, callbacks, sitting around talking about cases, and other such \"non-revenue generating\" activities, almost all the hours worked are productive.|According to the VIRMP site:\n",
      "\n",
      ">Commitment Process:  \n",
      "One of the most important aspects of participation in the VIRMP is the early commitment which is made by the applicant; that is, the applicant must agree to accept a position at any of the institutions or private practices which he/she ranked. When creating an account, the applicant will electronically sign an agreement to this effect. Failure to comply will result in sanctions including a ban from participation in the VIRMP for at least 3 years. This agreement must be completed online no later than February 16, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the deadline to withdraw has already passed. The match is not a traditional job offer/acceptance situation. When you signed the electronic commitment, that was your acceptance of whatever \"job offer\" is assigned to you by the match program. You have already accepted any potential job offer from all the internship programs you decided to apply for. You are already past the point of having the option to reject an internship \"offer\" without penalty.|There's no specific timeline after the match. Essentially, at some point in the days/weeks after the match, your internship institution should contact you and provide information regarding starting dates, orientation schedule, state licensing info (if needed), and to request any personal information they need for employment/HR purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are going to reject the internship, out of professional courtesy you should do that ASAP when you get your match result. You will still be penalized by the VIRMP with the 3 year freeze, and you likely will go on a Do Not Hire list at the institution, but you at least give the institution the opportunity to scramble and find a replacement for the internship spot you are vacating. \n",
      "\n",
      "You should probably be aware also that even after the 3 year VIRMP freeze, you would be seriously damaging your chances of ever matching in the future. Vet Med is a surprisingly small world, and many people (especially in academia) are well connected. Your decision to reject an internship after the match will reflect poorly on the faculty who wrote your reference letters, and they will almost certainly not agree to write you another letter if you decide to reapply in the future. Chances are none of your other current faculty would be comfortable writing a letter for you after a 3 year hiatus (especially knowing the reason for the hiatus). So during those three years you would need to establish new positive working relationships, ideally with boarded specialists, who would write your reference letters and directly address your previous actions. Even then, many internship programs would likely view your application with a very big red flag, unless there was an extenuating circumstance like an immediate family member fell ill and you had to pause/upend your career path in order to take care of them.|If you have the time and money to spend on training to be a CVT, it's fine. But don't approach it like a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a vet. It would be like becoming a Registered Nurse as a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a Medical Doctor. Essentially, you should view it as a backup career option, which is not totally unreasonable as the acceptance rate for vet school is like 8-12%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that although there is overlap in knowledge between the two careers, most of the classes you take aren't applicable to vet school pre-reqs (as far as I'm aware). So after you got your CVT, you would then need to go back to school and take all the vet school requirements. Furthermore, it is generally advantageous to have varied animal/industry experience, not just all small animal clinical experience. Do you know how many vet school applicants are small animal clinical vet techs/assistants? Like, almost all of them. It's very hard to differentiate yourself when you're an Animal Science major and working as a small animal vet tech/assistant like 90% of the applicants. Vet schools like to see people with experience in large/farm animal, exotics, lab animal, wildlife, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if you are happy with the idea of being a CVT as a career, and applying for vet school is more of a shot in the dark, it's a fine strategy. But if you're pretty focused/set on getting into vet school, there's better ways to spend your time and money to maximize your chances of getting in.|You probably won't like this answer, but it is quite difficult to become great at radiographs without active guidance. There's the adage of needing 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something, but what's usually lost from that concept is that it's 10,000 hours of \\*\\*guided\\*\\* practice. That is, being supervised by a teacher, trainer, coach, etc. to correct your mistakes and reinforce your successes. Without the guidance, you are very likely just reinforcing your bad habits. I have met many GPs and ER vets with years of experience who \\*think\\* they are good at rads, but in reality are probably worse than an average vet student who just finished their radiology rotation. To take it a step further, even radiologists who are working solo and/or teleradiology exclusive and therefore very rarely getting second opinions on their reads or followup from surgeons and pathologists also end up reinforcing bad habits. Without surgeons and pathologists to keep us honest, we may as well believe we have a 100% accuracy rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the hardest part about learning to read radiographs is being able to differentiate normal from abnormal. This is a lot harder than it sounds, because there is a very wide range of \"normal\" and it overlaps with a lot of \"abnormal.\" And what I mean by normal is \"no clinically significant abnormalities\", which is different from \"textbook normal.\" A prime example of this is abdominal radiographs on a patient with acute vomiting and diarrhea. Most of the time, I read these out as normal abdomen. The intern or ER doc may then come and ask, so these don't look like gastroenteritis? To which I ask, what are the radiographic signs of gastroenteritis? And they don't answer, because of course there aren't really any specific radiographic signs of gastroenteritis. I may see some things that I associate more often with gastroenteritis — fragmented gas pattern in the jejunum, diffuse gas dilation of the GI tract, etc. — and if the clinical history fits I may conclude acute gastroenteritis so the ordering clinician feels better about their workup. But in reality, those radiographic signs are pretty common in animals with no GI symptoms at all, so it wouldn't be wrong to just conclude \"normal abdomen.\" The goal of abdominal rads in the acutely vomiting animal is not to rule \\*\\*in\\*\\* gastroenteritis, it is to rule \\*\\*out\\*\\* mechanical obstruction, radiopaque foreign material, or other gross abnormalities like abdominal mass effect or ascites. \"Normal abdomen\" effectively rules those things out, leaving you with a provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis so long as the remainder of the clinical picture fits (i.e., not in acute renal failure, liver failure, Addisonian crisis, etc.). \n",
      "\n",
      "So ultimately this is where reading textbooks like Thrall is useful, even if the example images aren't amazing. You learn what the actual radiographic signs are that are classically associated with disease processes. There isn't really a better overall textbook out there than Thrall. For thorax specifically though, I like the BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Thoracic Imaging: [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/BSAVA+Manual+of+Canine+and+Feline+Thoracic+Imaging-p-9780905214979](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/bsava+manual+of+canine+and+feline+thoracic+imaging-p-9780905214979) It's a little bit dated (published 2008) but it's not like there have been major advances in thoracic radiography since then. The BSAVA abdomen and MSK books are decent, but not as good as the thorax one.\n",

I've never even owned a dog.|With the understanding that this Reddit post is not a job ad, biggest immediate red flag is “competitive wage.” Everyone says that, I’ve never seen any job ad that declares their salary not to be competitive. There’s a shortage of vets, and we’re inundated with recruiting emails. It’s not uncommon for us to simply delete/ignore any ads that don’t list an actual salary range. For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location. Including production, I would bet it’s not unusual for vets in OR to be making $180-200K. \n",

      "If you are a 501(c)(3) organization then new grads working for you should qualify for federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which is effectively a six figure bonus at the 10 year mark, paid for by the federal government.

      "\n",
      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations. A good nonprofit has to be run like a normal for-profit hospital, and then there has to be great fundraising and establishment of trust and engagement with the community. Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that. I don't know the pathology dept at NCSU specifically, but most pathology depts are usually pretty welcoming to any students who show real interest in pathology.|You need to put actual numbers in your job ads as a bare minimum to get any interest.

They are generally customized for an individual resident, and the \"alternative\" aspect is usually that the supervising radiologists will be spread out over 2 or more institutions rather than all in one location. There is still a requirement that a residency director be on location at the primary hospital for at least 50% of the time, and at least one other supervising radiologist (but typically more than one) be available for immediate live clinical consultation/interaction the rest of the time (usually meaning the resident goes to a different hospital with a radiologist, or the other radiologist is a contracted locum at the primary hospital, but technically could also be a virtual locum on a Zoom call all day). \n",

Realistically, in order to lose a case like that, you'd have to have a radiologist willing to testify that your miss was a major error that affected the outcome of the case and that a general practitioner should be expected to identify. Any doctor, radiologist or not, who claims that loss of serosal detail in the right cranial quadrant is a sure sign of pancreatitis that shouldn't be missed is full of shit. As a radiologist, I am well aware of all the classical radiographic signs of pancreatitis, and anecdotally based on followup abdominal ultrasounds in these cases I can confidently say the classical signs of pancreatitis on radiographs are both poorly sensitive and poorly specific.

I still wouldn't be overly concerned about being sued, as your error would have to be pretty egregious for a radiologist to testify that you should be penalized for it, but as a matter of basic medical standard and patient care you should maybe be concerned.

      "That is certainly a strategy you can take. Most radiologists are averse to negative explores, as that is pretty invasive. The \"old school\" approach was that if don't have a negative explore now and then, you're probably not doing enough surgeries. I think the more modern mindset is that every negative explore is a diagnostic failure. Cost of further diagnostics is certainly a consideration for our clients compared to human med, but if you had a complaint of vomiting and abdominal pain and went to the ER, and their initial imaging screening was inconclusive, I would bet you wouldn't seriously consider letting them do a diagnostic laparotomy on you in lieu of further imaging. I think so long as the pet owners understand that there are other noninvasive but perhaps less timely and more costly options available, and they are giving well informed consent to the exploratory, that's fine.|Challenging is very subjective and individual. I am a terrible surgeon, and so I would find being a surgeon quite challenging. I am also not very good at dealing with crashing patients and highly complex critical cases, so I would find ECC quite challenging. But some people are quite good at surgery and ECC, choose those for their careers, and probably don't feel overly challenged by their work.\n",

      "Vet med is not a good field to go into for \"lucrative.\" In a vacuum it is, as most new graduates are now making in the $110K-150K range. But most new graduates also have between $150-400K in student loans, so their overall financial situation is not great. Veterinarians are also (I think) the lowest paid of the doctoral-level healthcare professionals (human physicians, dentists, pharmacists, etc.). I believe the average vet also makes similar or less than the average nurse practitioner or physician assistant, which require fewer years of training and therefore lower educational cost. \n",
      "\n",
      "Being an emergency veterinarian can be quite lucrative, especially if you work in a relatively high-cost urban or suburban area, likely averaging in the $200-250K range. And being a board-certified specialist also can be quite lucrative, likely in the $250-350K range. But that also requires at minimum an additional 4 years of post-graduate training, at very low salary. And equivalent-level MD specialists will still make around twice as much as the veterinary specialist (i.e., while a veterinary surgeon may make $350-400K, an MD surgeon will make $700-800K).|I am not a surgeon (I am a radiologist) but I will take a stab at some of your questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Applicants who have years of experience in lieu of a rotating internship are generally at a disadvantage. The key is what the nature of your experience is. If you're working for 3 years as an ER vet in a referral hospital with all the standard specialties that one would have at a rotating internship, that is good experience. If you're working for 2 years in a general practice with minimal to no direct exposure to (boarded) specialists, that's bad experience. \n",
      "2. An internship recognized by EBVS is *probably* valid, but I would guess it is viewed as second tier unless it is well enough known as to be internationally reputable.\n",
      "3. Recs from vets in the UK would hold weight, so long as the vets are boarded specialists. DACVS probably holds more weight than DECVS, but only by a little.\n",
      "4. I have no idea how you would get involved in publishing something at a private clinic. It really just depends on whether you have contact with a boarded specialist who is willing to co-author the paper with you.\n",
      "5. The surgery diploma may help a little bit, but not much. Any ACVS residency is likely to be quite skeptical of the diploma/certificate, since they don't really know how rigorous the criteria are for passing. It would likely simply be viewed as \"candidate demonstrates an interest in small animal surgery.\"\n",
      "6. GPA comparison is very challenging unless the residency happens to have a faculty surgeon who is familiar with your school. If a class rank is available and can be shared as part of your application, that may hold more weight than straight GPA.\n",
      "7. They won't skip over your application without ECFVG/NAVLE, but you are likely at some kind of disadvantage without it. Also note that without ECFVG/NAVLE, even if you pass your boards you would be restricted to working at a university teaching hospital in the US.\n",
      "8. The most important part of the residency application is your references. Ideally, if you can find a surgeon (or two) who are double boarded in ACVS and ECVS to write letters, that's the best thing you can do. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the thing that residencies want to know is whether you will pass your boards and whether you will be a functional part of a surgery department for the 3 years of residency. The best way for them to know this is by having references from DACVS vets who know the candidate well and can vouch for their ability to survive a residency. This is the reason why DACVS references are preferred – they have been through the residency and passed the ACVS boards. DECVS may be perfectly knowledgeable and skilled surgeons, but they have not gone through an ACVS residency and passed those boards. There is an assumption that the two are probably close enough that a DECVS can evaluate whether a candidate is residency material, but again, if you have no DACVS references you are likely at a disadvantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the internship vs experience and the utility of the 1 year surgery diploma/certificate, ultimately the problem is that this is \"nontraditional\" for a candidate for an ACVS residency. There are many, many qualified applicants with a more traditional education/training background, many more than the number of residency spots. Last year, there were 238 applicants for 54 spots, with a match rate of 22.27%. More than 4 applicants for every 1 spot. And the vast majority of those applicants went to an AVMA-Accredited school, did a rotating internship in the US or Canada, and the vast majority of successful applicants also have one or more surgical internships as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "ACVS residencies have decided that this background – good grades at accredited school, rotating internship, surgical internship, multiple good DACVS references – is a good predictor of success for a resident. And there are more applicants who fit this profile than there are residency spots. So for you to supplant one of those candidates as a Spanish vet school grad, with no rotating internship, no surgical internship, and no DACVS references, you basically have to be a total rock star of a surgery candidate, and your DECVS references will need to say so emphatically.|\"Recognized\" is a nebulous word. Because vet med is minimally regulated in the US, anybody can do anything once they have a license. There are plenty of self-styled orthopedic \"specialists\" who have never been through a residency and are certainly not board-certified surgeons. But are boarded European specialists generally considered equivalent to the American specialist counterparts? Yes. At least in radiology, for example, a DECVDI is counted as a DACVR equivalent for the purpose of ACVR residency accreditation. Mind you, we are talking about boarded specialists here, not the Advanced Practitioner certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "To work as a vet in the US, you either have to have passed your NAVLE, or you have to work under the umbrella license of a university teaching hospital. This applies to boarded specialists as well. Having a DECVS or DECVDI does not allow you to bypass the need for a valid medical license. So if you are a DECVS who has not passed the NAVLE (either directly or after having gone through ECFVG or PAVE certification first), your only option is to work at a university. That said, there are many such European specialists working at universities, because academia pays like crap so it's hard to attract and retain faculty. \n",

      "Beyond that, though, what is the clinic organization and working conditions? 20% ownership at signing and \"can change the name to whatever they want\" suggests this new employee has immediate full control of the practice itself. To me this sounds like there's one vet who owns the clinic is looking to retire, allowing the new vet to rename/rebrand however they like. Most people these days are looking to work in a larger team environment, as opposed to being effectively a solo practitioner. This also begs the question of how many support staff are there for the X number of vets? Especially how many RVTs, how many VAs, how many kennel attendants, how many receptionists, and is there a practice manager?|There are no reliable data, that I'm aware of. And salaries across the board in vet med have changed drastically since the pandemic, so any data you find from 2020 or earlier is likely so outdated as to be totally useless at this point.

Especially if you decide to work as a mobile practitioner, and even more so if you learn basic abdominal ultrasound and add that to your mobile services.

I would guess the average cardiologist makes around $350K, and I personally know cardiologists making over $400K, which is probably mid-upper range for private practice. I would not be surprised if mobile cardiologists are making $500K+. This is all wild speculation, though.\n",

Veterinary radiology tech backgrounds run the gamut: vet assistants who are trained on-the-job to acquire imaging studies, registered vet techs (RVT) who are trained on-the-job and who may progress to vet tech specialization (VTS, involves benchmarks for experience and then passing a certifying exam), human medical radiologic technologists (RT) who shift to vet med part time or full time, human medical registered diagnostic medical sonographers (RDMS) who shift to vet med part time or full time. \n",

One of my friends was pre-vet, and she was pretty cool, so I switched sides (took a couple years off after college to pursue other random things but eventually settled on vet school).|Starting salary for a small animal private practice GP is about $130k right now, so the simple math says yes, the two additional years of working salary is worth the higher tuition.|That starts getting complicated. So if we assume 10% interest rate (which is higher than it is right now, I think), over 7 years you accrue $106k on a $270k loan, bringing you up to $376k when you finish in the US. On a $400k loan over 5 years at 10%, you accrue $109k in interest, putting you at $509k when you finish in the UK. That's a difference of $133k.

For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location.

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",

      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",

      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices.

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that. I don't know the pathology dept at NCSU specifically, but most pathology depts are usually pretty welcoming to any students who show real interest in pathology.|You need to put actual numbers in your job ads as a bare minimum to get any interest.

It depends of course on what branch of vet med you go into, and to some degree your own job selection (some people are just workaholics), but if when you say \"one of my parents works in human medicine\" you mean that they are a physician or work a physician's schedule, then you probably have a good idea of the time commitment. An average small animal clinical vet might have a schedule that looks like 4 weekday 10 hour shifts, a rotating weekend schedule that might be one Saturday per month, and likely 3-4 weeks vacation per year. Many vets end up having to spend extra time after their shift end to finish paperwork and do some client callbacks, so on average 40-50 hours per week actually working plus their weekend rotation. \n",

      "And as I said, there's a very wide range depending on what area of vet med you go into. Some people might be ER vets, pulling 12-14 hour shifts for 3 days in row then have like a week off.

If you need to take out major loans, then you’ll have to do some number crunching to figure out if you can make it work. Figure you’ll need 2-3 years to complete your academic and veterinary experience prerequisites, then 4 years of school means you’ll be in your mid-40s when you graduate. Tuition for 4 years will be $200-300K (depending on if you get into your in-state school). Most people need to budget another $100-150K for living expenses, but presumably your calculation will be different depending on your personal situation (Own your own home? Have a spouse/partner with a job? Have kids? Etc). \n",
      "\n",
      "Graduation in your mid-40s you’ll have about 20-25 years of working as a vet. Current new graduates in small animal private practice are averaging about $133K for their first contract. That will be up a bit in 8 years (although tuition and living expenses may also be higher than the figures I listed). Many vets these days have trouble paying off their loans in 20-25 years and may go for an income-based repayment plan (in which the balance of your loans are forgiven after 20 or 25 years). So if at age 40 you are entering vet school in the same financial situation as the typical 22 year old student, you may end up spending your entire career as a vet paying off the loans.|The ones I remember were the Nextel phones.

You could get away with a base in the $110-115K range if you think you can reasonably demonstrate that the new associate can expect to produce an additional $20-30K on top of that, but that would put you at right about average for a new graduate from last year. Chances are the 2024 graduates will be a little higher. Also, that $133K number is the average for the whole country, meaning a good number of new grads are above that. If you're in a HCOL area, chances are prospective vets will be expecting more.\n",

      "You say you can't afford 120K+ \"without growing a bit\" but if you are going from 1 doctor to 2, you have no choice but to grow a bit. Even if your current owner is looking to go part-time into semi-retirement, a new associate is going to be expecting full time work, not just taking over the 0.5 or even 0.75 time that the current owner is scaling back. So you will need to demonstrate that you have a plan in place for how to grow the business/caseload to make it worthwhile. You will likely need to hire at least one additional tech (CVT ideally) and likely also at least one additional vet assistant. You should ensure your business plan can accommodate the new hires, and be prepared to include it in the contract with the new vet.\n",

On average, most specialists (we are talking common clinical small animal specialties working in private practice) will make 2-3x the average GP and probably 1.5-2x the average ER (non-boarded) vet.

Most radiologists I know are working at least part time teleradiology and making about $400-500K for 40 hours/week. Those working full time teleradiology are making that amount for about 30 hours/week (and no commute). Those working full time in-house practice are making less, maybe $300-350K for 40-50 hours. Not bad at all, but comparable to other clinical specialties as opposed to absurd teleradiology bubble salary. One big advantage of radiology, of course, is that due to the lack of client contact and no need for referral letters, callbacks, sitting around talking about cases, and other such \"non-revenue generating\" activities, almost all the hours worked are productive.|According to the VIRMP site:\n",
      "\n",
      ">Commitment Process:  \n",
      "One of the most important aspects of participation in the VIRMP is the early commitment which is made by the applicant; that is, the applicant must agree to accept a position at any of the institutions or private practices which he/she ranked. When creating an account, the applicant will electronically sign an agreement to this effect. Failure to comply will result in sanctions including a ban from participation in the VIRMP for at least 3 years. This agreement must be completed online no later than February 16, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the deadline to withdraw has already passed. The match is not a traditional job offer/acceptance situation. When you signed the electronic commitment, that was your acceptance of whatever \"job offer\" is assigned to you by the match program. You have already accepted any potential job offer from all the internship programs you decided to apply for. You are already past the point of having the option to reject an internship \"offer\" without penalty.|There's no specific timeline after the match. Essentially, at some point in the days/weeks after the match, your internship institution should contact you and provide information regarding starting dates, orientation schedule, state licensing info (if needed), and to request any personal information they need for employment/HR purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are going to reject the internship, out of professional courtesy you should do that ASAP when you get your match result. You will still be penalized by the VIRMP with the 3 year freeze, and you likely will go on a Do Not Hire list at the institution, but you at least give the institution the opportunity to scramble and find a replacement for the internship spot you are vacating. \n",
      "\n",
      "You should probably be aware also that even after the 3 year VIRMP freeze, you would be seriously damaging your chances of ever matching in the future. Vet Med is a surprisingly small world, and many people (especially in academia) are well connected. Your decision to reject an internship after the match will reflect poorly on the faculty who wrote your reference letters, and they will almost certainly not agree to write you another letter if you decide to reapply in the future. Chances are none of your other current faculty would be comfortable writing a letter for you after a 3 year hiatus (especially knowing the reason for the hiatus). So during those three years you would need to establish new positive working relationships, ideally with boarded specialists, who would write your reference letters and directly address your previous actions. Even then, many internship programs would likely view your application with a very big red flag, unless there was an extenuating circumstance like an immediate family member fell ill and you had to pause/upend your career path in order to take care of them.|If you have the time and money to spend on training to be a CVT, it's fine. But don't approach it like a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a vet. It would be like becoming a Registered Nurse as a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a Medical Doctor. Essentially, you should view it as a backup career option, which is not totally unreasonable as the acceptance rate for vet school is like 8-12%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that although there is overlap in knowledge between the two careers, most of the classes you take aren't applicable to vet school pre-reqs (as far as I'm aware). So after you got your CVT, you would then need to go back to school and take all the vet school requirements. Furthermore, it is generally advantageous to have varied animal/industry experience, not just all small animal clinical experience. Do you know how many vet school applicants are small animal clinical vet techs/assistants? Like, almost all of them. It's very hard to differentiate yourself when you're an Animal Science major and working as a small animal vet tech/assistant like 90% of the applicants. Vet schools like to see people with experience in large/farm animal, exotics, lab animal, wildlife, etc. \n",

There's the adage of needing 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something, but what's usually lost from that concept is that it's 10,000 hours of \\*\\*guided\\*\\* practice. That is, being supervised by a teacher, trainer, coach, etc. to correct your mistakes and reinforce your successes. Without the guidance, you are very likely just reinforcing your bad habits. I have met many GPs and ER vets with years of experience who \\*think\\* they are good at rads, but in reality are probably worse than an average vet student who just finished their radiology rotation. To take it a step further, even radiologists who are working solo and/or teleradiology exclusive and therefore very rarely getting second opinions on their reads or followup from surgeons and pathologists also end up reinforcing bad habits. Without surgeons and pathologists to keep us honest, we may as well believe we have a 100% accuracy rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the hardest part about learning to read radiographs is being able to differentiate normal from abnormal. This is a lot harder than it sounds, because there is a very wide range of \"normal\" and it overlaps with a lot of \"abnormal.\" And what I mean by normal is \"no clinically significant abnormalities\", which is different from \"textbook normal.\" A prime example of this is abdominal radiographs on a patient with acute vomiting and diarrhea. Most of the time, I read these out as normal abdomen. The intern or ER doc may then come and ask, so these don't look like gastroenteritis? To which I ask, what are the radiographic signs of gastroenteritis? And they don't answer, because of course there aren't really any specific radiographic signs of gastroenteritis. I may see some things that I associate more often with gastroenteritis — fragmented gas pattern in the jejunum, diffuse gas dilation of the GI tract, etc. — and if the clinical history fits I may conclude acute gastroenteritis so the ordering clinician feels better about their workup. But in reality, those radiographic signs are pretty common in animals with no GI symptoms at all, so it wouldn't be wrong to just conclude \"normal abdomen.\" The goal of abdominal rads in the acutely vomiting animal is not to rule \\*\\*in\\*\\* gastroenteritis, it is to rule \\*\\*out\\*\\* mechanical obstruction, radiopaque foreign material, or other gross abnormalities like abdominal mass effect or ascites. \"Normal abdomen\" effectively rules those things out, leaving you with a provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis so long as the remainder of the clinical picture fits (i.e., not in acute renal failure, liver failure, Addisonian crisis, etc.). \n",
      "\n",
      "So ultimately this is where reading textbooks like Thrall is useful, even if the example images aren't amazing. You learn what the actual radiographic signs are that are classically associated with disease processes. There isn't really a better overall textbook out there than Thrall. For thorax specifically though, I like the BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Thoracic Imaging: [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/BSAVA+Manual+of+Canine+and+Feline+Thoracic+Imaging-p-9780905214979](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/bsava+manual+of+canine+and+feline+thoracic+imaging-p-9780905214979) It's a little bit dated (published 2008) but it's not like there have been major advances in thoracic radiography since then.

There’s a shortage of vets, and we’re inundated with recruiting emails. It’s not uncommon for us to simply delete/ignore any ads that don’t list an actual salary range. For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location.

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices.

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that.

They are generally customized for an individual resident, and the \"alternative\" aspect is usually that the supervising radiologists will be spread out over 2 or more institutions rather than all in one location. There is still a requirement that a residency director be on location at the primary hospital for at least 50% of the time, and at least one other supervising radiologist (but typically more than one) be available for immediate live clinical consultation/interaction the rest of the time (usually meaning the resident goes to a different hospital with a radiologist, or the other radiologist is a contracted locum at the primary hospital, but technically could also be a virtual locum on a Zoom call all day). \n",

Realistically, in order to lose a case like that, you'd have to have a radiologist willing to testify that your miss was a major error that affected the outcome of the case and that a general practitioner should be expected to identify. Any doctor, radiologist or not, who claims that loss of serosal detail in the right cranial quadrant is a sure sign of pancreatitis that shouldn't be missed is full of shit. As a radiologist, I am well aware of all the classical radiographic signs of pancreatitis, and anecdotally based on followup abdominal ultrasounds in these cases I can confidently say the classical signs of pancreatitis on radiographs are both poorly sensitive and poorly specific.

That's, like, relatively high. So chances are non-radiologists would have a significantly higher rate of major errors. I still wouldn't be overly concerned about being sued, as your error would have to be pretty egregious for a radiologist to testify that you should be penalized for it, but as a matter of basic medical standard and patient care you should maybe be concerned.

      "That is certainly a strategy you can take. Most radiologists are averse to negative explores, as that is pretty invasive. The \"old school\" approach was that if don't have a negative explore now and then, you're probably not doing enough surgeries. I think the more modern mindset is that every negative explore is a diagnostic failure. Cost of further diagnostics is certainly a consideration for our clients compared to human med, but if you had a complaint of vomiting and abdominal pain and went to the ER, and their initial imaging screening was inconclusive, I would bet you wouldn't seriously consider letting them do a diagnostic laparotomy on you in lieu of further imaging. I think so long as the pet owners understand that there are other noninvasive but perhaps less timely and more costly options available, and they are giving well informed consent to the exploratory, that's fine.|Challenging is very subjective and individual. I am a terrible surgeon, and so I would find being a surgeon quite challenging. I am also not very good at dealing with crashing patients and highly complex critical cases, so I would find ECC quite challenging.

      "Vet med is not a good field to go into for \"lucrative.\" In a vacuum it is, as most new graduates are now making in the $110K-150K range. But most new graduates also have between $150-400K in student loans, so their overall financial situation is not great. Veterinarians are also (I think) the lowest paid of the doctoral-level healthcare professionals (human physicians, dentists, pharmacists, etc.). I believe the average vet also makes similar or less than the average nurse practitioner or physician assistant, which require fewer years of training and therefore lower educational cost. \n",

      "Being an emergency veterinarian can be quite lucrative, especially if you work in a relatively high-cost urban or suburban area, likely averaging in the $200-250K range.

But that also requires at minimum an additional 4 years of post-graduate training, at very low salary. And equivalent-level MD specialists will still make around twice as much as the veterinary specialist (i.e., while a veterinary surgeon may make $350-400K, an MD surgeon will make $700-800K).|I am not a surgeon (I am a radiologist) but I will take a stab at some of your questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Applicants who have years of experience in lieu of a rotating internship are generally at a disadvantage. The key is what the nature of your experience is. If you're working for 3 years as an ER vet in a referral hospital with all the standard specialties that one would have at a rotating internship, that is good experience. If you're working for 2 years in a general practice with minimal to no direct exposure to (boarded) specialists, that's bad experience. \n",
      "2. An internship recognized by EBVS is *probably* valid, but I would guess it is viewed as second tier unless it is well enough known as to be internationally reputable.\n",
      "3. Recs from vets in the UK would hold weight, so long as the vets are boarded specialists. DACVS probably holds more weight than DECVS, but only by a little.\n",
      "4. I have no idea how you would get involved in publishing something at a private clinic. It really just depends on whether you have contact with a boarded specialist who is willing to co-author the paper with you.\n",
      "5. The surgery diploma may help a little bit, but not much. Any ACVS residency is likely to be quite skeptical of the diploma/certificate, since they don't really know how rigorous the criteria are for passing. It would likely simply be viewed as \"candidate demonstrates an interest in small animal surgery.\"\n",
      "6. GPA comparison is very challenging unless the residency happens to have a faculty surgeon who is familiar with your school. If a class rank is available and can be shared as part of your application, that may hold more weight than straight GPA.\n",
      "7. They won't skip over your application without ECFVG/NAVLE, but you are likely at some kind of disadvantage without it. Also note that without ECFVG/NAVLE, even if you pass your boards you would be restricted to working at a university teaching hospital in the US.\n",
      "8. The most important part of the residency application is your references. Ideally, if you can find a surgeon (or two) who are double boarded in ACVS and ECVS to write letters, that's the best thing you can do. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the thing that residencies want to know is whether you will pass your boards and whether you will be a functional part of a surgery department for the 3 years of residency. The best way for them to know this is by having references from DACVS vets who know the candidate well and can vouch for their ability to survive a residency. This is the reason why DACVS references are preferred – they have been through the residency and passed the ACVS boards. DECVS may be perfectly knowledgeable and skilled surgeons, but they have not gone through an ACVS residency and passed those boards. There is an assumption that the two are probably close enough that a DECVS can evaluate whether a candidate is residency material, but again, if you have no DACVS references you are likely at a disadvantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the internship vs experience and the utility of the 1 year surgery diploma/certificate, ultimately the problem is that this is \"nontraditional\" for a candidate for an ACVS residency. There are many, many qualified applicants with a more traditional education/training background, many more than the number of residency spots. Last year, there were 238 applicants for 54 spots, with a match rate of 22.27%. More than 4 applicants for every 1 spot. And the vast majority of those applicants went to an AVMA-Accredited school, did a rotating internship in the US or Canada, and the vast majority of successful applicants also have one or more surgical internships as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "ACVS residencies have decided that this background – good grades at accredited school, rotating internship, surgical internship, multiple good DACVS references – is a good predictor of success for a resident. And there are more applicants who fit this profile than there are residency spots. So for you to supplant one of those candidates as a Spanish vet school grad, with no rotating internship, no surgical internship, and no DACVS references, you basically have to be a total rock star of a surgery candidate, and your DECVS references will need to say so emphatically.|\"Recognized\" is a nebulous word. Because vet med is minimally regulated in the US, anybody can do anything once they have a license. There are plenty of self-styled orthopedic \"specialists\" who have never been through a residency and are certainly not board-certified surgeons. But are boarded European specialists generally considered equivalent to the American specialist counterparts? Yes. At least in radiology, for example, a DECVDI is counted as a DACVR equivalent for the purpose of ACVR residency accreditation. Mind you, we are talking about boarded specialists here, not the Advanced Practitioner certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "To work as a vet in the US, you either have to have passed your NAVLE, or you have to work under the umbrella license of a university teaching hospital. This applies to boarded specialists as well. Having a DECVS or DECVDI does not allow you to bypass the need for a valid medical license. So if you are a DECVS who has not passed the NAVLE (either directly or after having gone through ECFVG or PAVE certification first), your only option is to work at a university. That said, there are many such European specialists working at universities, because academia pays like crap so it's hard to attract and retain faculty. \n",

      "I think that if your general vet med education is still fresh in your mind, and your plan (being a US citizen) is to live/work in the US permanently, it would be advisable to go through the ECFVG. Even with the cost, you will make a LOT more money if you have the ability to work in private practice, whether as a GP, an ER vet, or a specialist.|As many have already noted, the salary is pretty low. $125K is the mean starting salary for 2023 new graduates in private practice. Mean/average salary, meaning a very significant number of new grads are making more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond that, though, what is the clinic organization and working conditions? 20% ownership at signing and \"can change the name to whatever they want\" suggests this new employee has immediate full control of the practice itself. To me this sounds like there's one vet who owns the clinic is looking to retire, allowing the new vet to rename/rebrand however they like. Most people these days are looking to work in a larger team environment, as opposed to being effectively a solo practitioner. This also begs the question of how many support staff are there for the X number of vets? Especially how many RVTs, how many VAs, how many kennel attendants, how many receptionists, and is there a practice manager?|There are no reliable data, that I'm aware of. And salaries across the board in vet med have changed drastically since the pandemic, so any data you find from 2020 or earlier is likely so outdated as to be totally useless at this point.

      "Generally speaking, cardiologists are in high demand and make a lot of money. Especially if you decide to work as a mobile practitioner, and even more so if you learn basic abdominal ultrasound and add that to your mobile services.

I would guess the average cardiologist makes around $350K, and I personally know cardiologists making over $400K, which is probably mid-upper range for private practice. I would not be surprised if mobile cardiologists are making $500K+. This is all wild speculation, though.\n",

Veterinary radiology tech backgrounds run the gamut: vet assistants who are trained on-the-job to acquire imaging studies, registered vet techs (RVT) who are trained on-the-job and who may progress to vet tech specialization (VTS, involves benchmarks for experience and then passing a certifying exam), human medical radiologic technologists (RT) who shift to vet med part time or full time, human medical registered diagnostic medical sonographers (RDMS) who shift to vet med part time or full time. \n",

So if we assume 10% interest rate (which is higher than it is right now, I think), over 7 years you accrue $106k on a $270k loan, bringing you up to $376k when you finish in the US. On a $400k loan over 5 years at 10%, you accrue $109k in interest, putting you at $509k when you finish in the UK. That's a difference of $133k.

For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location.

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.\n",

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that. I don't know the pathology dept at NCSU specifically, but most pathology depts are usually pretty welcoming to any students who show real interest in pathology.|You need to put actual numbers in your job ads as a bare minimum to get any interest.

It depends of course on what branch of vet med you go into, and to some degree your own job selection (some people are just workaholics), but if when you say \"one of my parents works in human medicine\" you mean that they are a physician or work a physician's schedule, then you probably have a good idea of the time commitment. An average small animal clinical vet might have a schedule that looks like 4 weekday 10 hour shifts, a rotating weekend schedule that might be one Saturday per month, and likely 3-4 weeks vacation per year. Many vets end up having to spend extra time after their shift end to finish paperwork and do some client callbacks, so on average 40-50 hours per week actually working plus their weekend rotation. \n",

I think most of the large global teleradiology companies (Antech, IDEXX, VetCT, etc.) might have a slight differential pay for their radiologists based on cost of living in their country of residence, but I am not totally sure about that. It won't be a big difference, though, because they don't want to discourage radiologists from living in time zones with reduced coverage (most of their radiologists will be in the North American and Western European time zones, so coverage in Asia/Australia tends to be poor).|I don't know any veterinary or human radiologists who are concerned about AI taking our jobs in our lifetime. Perhaps we are all collectively delusional, but I doubt it. For your consideration: In order for AI to \"replace\" a radiologist, the company who owns the AI product would need to accept liability for interpretation errors made by their AI.|Plenty of people do a mid-career switch to vet med. There were two students in my class in their 50s, and several in their 30s and 40s. Really the biggest question is financial. If you’ve made enough money in your career up to now that you can fund the educational path without loans, you are good to go. If you need to take out major loans, then you’ll have to do some number crunching to figure out if you can make it work. Figure you’ll need 2-3 years to complete your academic and veterinary experience prerequisites, then 4 years of school means you’ll be in your mid-40s when you graduate. Tuition for 4 years will be $200-300K (depending on if you get into your in-state school). Most people need to budget another $100-150K for living expenses, but presumably your calculation will be different depending on your personal situation (Own your own home? Have a spouse/partner with a job? Have kids? Etc). \n",

      "Graduation in your mid-40s you’ll have about 20-25 years of working as a vet. Current new graduates in small animal private practice are averaging about $133K for their first contract. That will be up a bit in 8 years (although tuition and living expenses may also be higher than the figures I listed). Many vets these days have trouble paying off their loans in 20-25 years and may go for an income-based repayment plan (in which the balance of your loans are forgiven after 20 or 25 years). So if at age 40 you are entering vet school in the same financial situation as the typical 22 year old student, you may end up spending your entire career as a vet paying off the loans.|The ones I remember were the Nextel phones.

Chances are the 2024 graduates will be a little higher. Also, that $133K number is the average for the whole country, meaning a good number of new grads are above that.

So you will need to demonstrate that you have a plan in place for how to grow the business/caseload to make it worthwhile. You will likely need to hire at least one additional tech (CVT ideally) and likely also at least one additional vet assistant. You should ensure your business plan can accommodate the new hires, and be prepared to include it in the contract with the new vet.\n",

Those working full time teleradiology are making that amount for about 30 hours/week (and no commute). Those working full time in-house practice are making less, maybe $300-350K for 40-50 hours. Not bad at all, but comparable to other clinical specialties as opposed to absurd teleradiology bubble salary.

      "\n",
      ">Commitment Process:  \n",
      "One of the most important aspects of participation in the VIRMP is the early commitment which is made by the applicant; that is, the applicant must agree to accept a position at any of the institutions or private practices which he/she ranked. When creating an account, the applicant will electronically sign an agreement to this effect. Failure to comply will result in sanctions including a ban from participation in the VIRMP for at least 3 years. This agreement must be completed online no later than February 16, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the deadline to withdraw has already passed. The match is not a traditional job offer/acceptance situation. When you signed the electronic commitment, that was your acceptance of whatever \"job offer\" is assigned to you by the match program. You have already accepted any potential job offer from all the internship programs you decided to apply for. You are already past the point of having the option to reject an internship \"offer\" without penalty.|There's no specific timeline after the match. Essentially, at some point in the days/weeks after the match, your internship institution should contact you and provide information regarding starting dates, orientation schedule, state licensing info (if needed), and to request any personal information they need for employment/HR purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are going to reject the internship, out of professional courtesy you should do that ASAP when you get your match result. You will still be penalized by the VIRMP with the 3 year freeze, and you likely will go on a Do Not Hire list at the institution, but you at least give the institution the opportunity to scramble and find a replacement for the internship spot you are vacating. \n",
      "\n",
      "You should probably be aware also that even after the 3 year VIRMP freeze, you would be seriously damaging your chances of ever matching in the future. Vet Med is a surprisingly small world, and many people (especially in academia) are well connected. Your decision to reject an internship after the match will reflect poorly on the faculty who wrote your reference letters, and they will almost certainly not agree to write you another letter if you decide to reapply in the future. Chances are none of your other current faculty would be comfortable writing a letter for you after a 3 year hiatus (especially knowing the reason for the hiatus). So during those three years you would need to establish new positive working relationships, ideally with boarded specialists, who would write your reference letters and directly address your previous actions. Even then, many internship programs would likely view your application with a very big red flag, unless there was an extenuating circumstance like an immediate family member fell ill and you had to pause/upend your career path in order to take care of them.|If you have the time and money to spend on training to be a CVT, it's fine. But don't approach it like a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a vet. It would be like becoming a Registered Nurse as a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a Medical Doctor. Essentially, you should view it as a backup career option, which is not totally unreasonable as the acceptance rate for vet school is like 8-12%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that although there is overlap in knowledge between the two careers, most of the classes you take aren't applicable to vet school pre-reqs (as far as I'm aware). So after you got your CVT, you would then need to go back to school and take all the vet school requirements. Furthermore, it is generally advantageous to have varied animal/industry experience, not just all small animal clinical experience. Do you know how many vet school applicants are small animal clinical vet techs/assistants? Like, almost all of them. It's very hard to differentiate yourself when you're an Animal Science major and working as a small animal vet tech/assistant like 90% of the applicants. Vet schools like to see people with experience in large/farm animal, exotics, lab animal, wildlife, etc. \n",

There's the adage of needing 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something, but what's usually lost from that concept is that it's 10,000 hours of \\*\\*guided\\*\\* practice. That is, being supervised by a teacher, trainer, coach, etc. to correct your mistakes and reinforce your successes. Without the guidance, you are very likely just reinforcing your bad habits. I have met many GPs and ER vets with years of experience who \\*think\\* they are good at rads, but in reality are probably worse than an average vet student who just finished their radiology rotation. To take it a step further, even radiologists who are working solo and/or teleradiology exclusive and therefore very rarely getting second opinions on their reads or followup from surgeons and pathologists also end up reinforcing bad habits. Without surgeons and pathologists to keep us honest, we may as well believe we have a 100% accuracy rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the hardest part about learning to read radiographs is being able to differentiate normal from abnormal. This is a lot harder than it sounds, because there is a very wide range of \"normal\" and it overlaps with a lot of \"abnormal.\" And what I mean by normal is \"no clinically significant abnormalities\", which is different from \"textbook normal.\" A prime example of this is abdominal radiographs on a patient with acute vomiting and diarrhea. Most of the time, I read these out as normal abdomen. The intern or ER doc may then come and ask, so these don't look like gastroenteritis? To which I ask, what are the radiographic signs of gastroenteritis? And they don't answer, because of course there aren't really any specific radiographic signs of gastroenteritis. I may see some things that I associate more often with gastroenteritis — fragmented gas pattern in the jejunum, diffuse gas dilation of the GI tract, etc. — and if the clinical history fits I may conclude acute gastroenteritis so the ordering clinician feels better about their workup. But in reality, those radiographic signs are pretty common in animals with no GI symptoms at all, so it wouldn't be wrong to just conclude \"normal abdomen.\" The goal of abdominal rads in the acutely vomiting animal is not to rule \\*\\*in\\*\\* gastroenteritis, it is to rule \\*\\*out\\*\\* mechanical obstruction, radiopaque foreign material, or other gross abnormalities like abdominal mass effect or ascites. \"Normal abdomen\" effectively rules those things out, leaving you with a provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis so long as the remainder of the clinical picture fits (i.e., not in acute renal failure, liver failure, Addisonian crisis, etc.). \n",
      "\n",
      "So ultimately this is where reading textbooks like Thrall is useful, even if the example images aren't amazing. You learn what the actual radiographic signs are that are classically associated with disease processes. There isn't really a better overall textbook out there than Thrall. For thorax specifically though, I like the BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Thoracic Imaging: [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/BSAVA+Manual+of+Canine+and+Feline+Thoracic+Imaging-p-9780905214979](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/bsava+manual+of+canine+and+feline+thoracic+imaging-p-9780905214979) It's a little bit dated (published 2008) but it's not like there have been major advances in thoracic radiography since then.

For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location.

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",

      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go.

      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices.

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that.

They are generally customized for an individual resident, and the \"alternative\" aspect is usually that the supervising radiologists will be spread out over 2 or more institutions rather than all in one location. There is still a requirement that a residency director be on location at the primary hospital for at least 50% of the time, and at least one other supervising radiologist (but typically more than one) be available for immediate live clinical consultation/interaction the rest of the time (usually meaning the resident goes to a different hospital with a radiologist, or the other radiologist is a contracted locum at the primary hospital, but technically could also be a virtual locum on a Zoom call all day). \n",

Missing a GI obstruction would be an example. On the flip side, incorrectly diagnosing a GI obstruction leading to a negative surgical explore would arguably also be a major misdiagnosis. Without knowing your actual skill level at reading radiographs I don't know how concerned you should be about things like that.\n",

That's, like, relatively high. So chances are non-radiologists would have a significantly higher rate of major errors. I still wouldn't be overly concerned about being sued, as your error would have to be pretty egregious for a radiologist to testify that you should be penalized for it, but as a matter of basic medical standard and patient care you should maybe be concerned. I would say most radiologists are at least a little concerned about a bad miss on any case we read.\n",

I think the more modern mindset is that every negative explore is a diagnostic failure. Cost of further diagnostics is certainly a consideration for our clients compared to human med, but if you had a complaint of vomiting and abdominal pain and went to the ER, and their initial imaging screening was inconclusive, I would bet you wouldn't seriously consider letting them do a diagnostic laparotomy on you in lieu of further imaging. I think so long as the pet owners understand that there are other noninvasive but perhaps less timely and more costly options available, and they are giving well informed consent to the exploratory, that's fine.|Challenging is very subjective and individual.

      "Vet med is not a good field to go into for \"lucrative.\" In a vacuum it is, as most new graduates are now making in the $110K-150K range. But most new graduates also have between $150-400K in student loans, so their overall financial situation is not great. Veterinarians are also (I think) the lowest paid of the doctoral-level healthcare professionals (human physicians, dentists, pharmacists, etc.). I believe the average vet also makes similar or less than the average nurse practitioner or physician assistant, which require fewer years of training and therefore lower educational cost. \n",

      "\n",
      "1. Applicants who have years of experience in lieu of a rotating internship are generally at a disadvantage. The key is what the nature of your experience is. If you're working for 3 years as an ER vet in a referral hospital with all the standard specialties that one would have at a rotating internship, that is good experience. If you're working for 2 years in a general practice with minimal to no direct exposure to (boarded) specialists, that's bad experience. \n",
      "2. An internship recognized by EBVS is *probably* valid, but I would guess it is viewed as second tier unless it is well enough known as to be internationally reputable.\n",
      "3. Recs from vets in the UK would hold weight, so long as the vets are boarded specialists. DACVS probably holds more weight than DECVS, but only by a little.\n",
      "4. I have no idea how you would get involved in publishing something at a private clinic. It really just depends on whether you have contact with a boarded specialist who is willing to co-author the paper with you.\n",
      "5. The surgery diploma may help a little bit, but not much. Any ACVS residency is likely to be quite skeptical of the diploma/certificate, since they don't really know how rigorous the criteria are for passing. It would likely simply be viewed as \"candidate demonstrates an interest in small animal surgery.\"\n",
      "6. GPA comparison is very challenging unless the residency happens to have a faculty surgeon who is familiar with your school. If a class rank is available and can be shared as part of your application, that may hold more weight than straight GPA.\n",
      "7. They won't skip over your application without ECFVG/NAVLE, but you are likely at some kind of disadvantage without it. Also note that without ECFVG/NAVLE, even if you pass your boards you would be restricted to working at a university teaching hospital in the US.\n",
      "8. The most important part of the residency application is your references. Ideally, if you can find a surgeon (or two) who are double boarded in ACVS and ECVS to write letters, that's the best thing you can do. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the thing that residencies want to know is whether you will pass your boards and whether you will be a functional part of a surgery department for the 3 years of residency. The best way for them to know this is by having references from DACVS vets who know the candidate well and can vouch for their ability to survive a residency. This is the reason why DACVS references are preferred – they have been through the residency and passed the ACVS boards. DECVS may be perfectly knowledgeable and skilled surgeons, but they have not gone through an ACVS residency and passed those boards. There is an assumption that the two are probably close enough that a DECVS can evaluate whether a candidate is residency material, but again, if you have no DACVS references you are likely at a disadvantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the internship vs experience and the utility of the 1 year surgery diploma/certificate, ultimately the problem is that this is \"nontraditional\" for a candidate for an ACVS residency. There are many, many qualified applicants with a more traditional education/training background, many more than the number of residency spots. Last year, there were 238 applicants for 54 spots, with a match rate of 22.27%. More than 4 applicants for every 1 spot. And the vast majority of those applicants went to an AVMA-Accredited school, did a rotating internship in the US or Canada, and the vast majority of successful applicants also have one or more surgical internships as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "ACVS residencies have decided that this background – good grades at accredited school, rotating internship, surgical internship, multiple good DACVS references – is a good predictor of success for a resident. And there are more applicants who fit this profile than there are residency spots. So for you to supplant one of those candidates as a Spanish vet school grad, with no rotating internship, no surgical internship, and no DACVS references, you basically have to be a total rock star of a surgery candidate, and your DECVS references will need to say so emphatically.|\"Recognized\" is a nebulous word. Because vet med is minimally regulated in the US, anybody can do anything once they have a license. There are plenty of self-styled orthopedic \"specialists\" who have never been through a residency and are certainly not board-certified surgeons. But are boarded European specialists generally considered equivalent to the American specialist counterparts? Yes. At least in radiology, for example, a DECVDI is counted as a DACVR equivalent for the purpose of ACVR residency accreditation. Mind you, we are talking about boarded specialists here, not the Advanced Practitioner certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "To work as a vet in the US, you either have to have passed your NAVLE, or you have to work under the umbrella license of a university teaching hospital. This applies to boarded specialists as well. Having a DECVS or DECVDI does not allow you to bypass the need for a valid medical license. So if you are a DECVS who has not passed the NAVLE (either directly or after having gone through ECFVG or PAVE certification first), your only option is to work at a university. That said, there are many such European specialists working at universities, because academia pays like crap so it's hard to attract and retain faculty. \n",

      "Beyond that, though, what is the clinic organization and working conditions? 20% ownership at signing and \"can change the name to whatever they want\" suggests this new employee has immediate full control of the practice itself. To me this sounds like there's one vet who owns the clinic is looking to retire, allowing the new vet to rename/rebrand however they like. Most people these days are looking to work in a larger team environment, as opposed to being effectively a solo practitioner. This also begs the question of how many support staff are there for the X number of vets? Especially how many RVTs, how many VAs, how many kennel attendants, how many receptionists, and is there a practice manager?|There are no reliable data, that I'm aware of. And salaries across the board in vet med have changed drastically since the pandemic, so any data you find from 2020 or earlier is likely so outdated as to be totally useless at this point.

On a $400k loan over 5 years at 10%, you accrue $109k in interest, putting you at $509k when you finish in the UK. That's a difference of $133k.

Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",

So the question then becomes \"What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?\" If you're more into the \"interventional\" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go.

      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio.

For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists.

There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that.

It depends of course on what branch of vet med you go into, and to some degree your own job selection (some people are just workaholics), but if when you say \"one of my parents works in human medicine\" you mean that they are a physician or work a physician's schedule, then you probably have a good idea of the time commitment.

An internship should be rotating, meaning you spend weeks at a time working in different specialty services under the tutelage of board-certified vets, usually at minimum Internal Medicine, Surgery, and ECC (but usually much more, such as Neuro, Cardio, Onco, Anesthesia, Ophtho, Derm, Radiology, etc. depending on how large the specialty hospital is).

Most of the large global teleradiology companies pay quite well (in the US most full-time teleradiologists will make in the range of $300-600K (USD) annually. I think most of the large global teleradiology companies (Antech, IDEXX, VetCT, etc.) might have a slight differential pay for their radiologists based on cost of living in their country of residence, but I am not totally sure about that. It won't be a big difference, though, because they don't want to discourage radiologists from living in time zones with reduced coverage (most of their radiologists will be in the North American and Western European time zones, so coverage in Asia/Australia tends to be poor).|I don't know any veterinary or human radiologists who are concerned about AI taking our jobs in our lifetime. Perhaps we are all collectively delusional, but I doubt it.

There were two students in my class in their 50s, and several in their 30s and 40s. Really the biggest question is financial. If you’ve made enough money in your career up to now that you can fund the educational path without loans, you are good to go. If you need to take out major loans, then you’ll have to do some number crunching to figure out if you can make it work. Figure you’ll need 2-3 years to complete your academic and veterinary experience prerequisites, then 4 years of school means you’ll be in your mid-40s when you graduate. Tuition for 4 years will be $200-300K (depending on if you get into your in-state school). Most people need to budget another $100-150K for living expenses, but presumably your calculation will be different depending on your personal situation (Own your own home? Have a spouse/partner with a job? Have kids? Etc). \n",

      "Graduation in your mid-40s you’ll have about 20-25 years of working as a vet. Current new graduates in small animal private practice are averaging about $133K for their first contract. That will be up a bit in 8 years (although tuition and living expenses may also be higher than the figures I listed). Many vets these days have trouble paying off their loans in 20-25 years and may go for an income-based repayment plan (in which the balance of your loans are forgiven after 20 or 25 years). So if at age 40 you are entering vet school in the same financial situation as the typical 22 year old student, you may end up spending your entire career as a vet paying off the loans.|The ones I remember were the Nextel phones.

      "\n",
      ">Commitment Process:  \n",
      "One of the most important aspects of participation in the VIRMP is the early commitment which is made by the applicant; that is, the applicant must agree to accept a position at any of the institutions or private practices which he/she ranked. When creating an account, the applicant will electronically sign an agreement to this effect. Failure to comply will result in sanctions including a ban from participation in the VIRMP for at least 3 years. This agreement must be completed online no later than February 16, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the deadline to withdraw has already passed. The match is not a traditional job offer/acceptance situation. When you signed the electronic commitment, that was your acceptance of whatever \"job offer\" is assigned to you by the match program. You have already accepted any potential job offer from all the internship programs you decided to apply for. You are already past the point of having the option to reject an internship \"offer\" without penalty.|There's no specific timeline after the match. Essentially, at some point in the days/weeks after the match, your internship institution should contact you and provide information regarding starting dates, orientation schedule, state licensing info (if needed), and to request any personal information they need for employment/HR purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are going to reject the internship, out of professional courtesy you should do that ASAP when you get your match result. You will still be penalized by the VIRMP with the 3 year freeze, and you likely will go on a Do Not Hire list at the institution, but you at least give the institution the opportunity to scramble and find a replacement for the internship spot you are vacating. \n",
      "\n",
      "You should probably be aware also that even after the 3 year VIRMP freeze, you would be seriously damaging your chances of ever matching in the future. Vet Med is a surprisingly small world, and many people (especially in academia) are well connected. Your decision to reject an internship after the match will reflect poorly on the faculty who wrote your reference letters, and they will almost certainly not agree to write you another letter if you decide to reapply in the future. Chances are none of your other current faculty would be comfortable writing a letter for you after a 3 year hiatus (especially knowing the reason for the hiatus). So during those three years you would need to establish new positive working relationships, ideally with boarded specialists, who would write your reference letters and directly address your previous actions. Even then, many internship programs would likely view your application with a very big red flag, unless there was an extenuating circumstance like an immediate family member fell ill and you had to pause/upend your career path in order to take care of them.|If you have the time and money to spend on training to be a CVT, it's fine. But don't approach it like a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a vet. It would be like becoming a Registered Nurse as a \"stepping stone\" to becoming a Medical Doctor. Essentially, you should view it as a backup career option, which is not totally unreasonable as the acceptance rate for vet school is like 8-12%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that although there is overlap in knowledge between the two careers, most of the classes you take aren't applicable to vet school pre-reqs (as far as I'm aware). So after you got your CVT, you would then need to go back to school and take all the vet school requirements. Furthermore, it is generally advantageous to have varied animal/industry experience, not just all small animal clinical experience. Do you know how many vet school applicants are small animal clinical vet techs/assistants? Like, almost all of them. It's very hard to differentiate yourself when you're an Animal Science major and working as a small animal vet tech/assistant like 90% of the applicants. Vet schools like to see people with experience in large/farm animal, exotics, lab animal, wildlife, etc. \n",

There's the adage of needing 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something, but what's usually lost from that concept is that it's 10,000 hours of \\*\\*guided\\*\\* practice. That is, being supervised by a teacher, trainer, coach, etc. to correct your mistakes and reinforce your successes. Without the guidance, you are very likely just reinforcing your bad habits. I have met many GPs and ER vets with years of experience who \\*think\\* they are good at rads, but in reality are probably worse than an average vet student who just finished their radiology rotation. To take it a step further, even radiologists who are working solo and/or teleradiology exclusive and therefore very rarely getting second opinions on their reads or followup from surgeons and pathologists also end up reinforcing bad habits. Without surgeons and pathologists to keep us honest, we may as well believe we have a 100% accuracy rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me, the hardest part about learning to read radiographs is being able to differentiate normal from abnormal. This is a lot harder than it sounds, because there is a very wide range of \"normal\" and it overlaps with a lot of \"abnormal.\" And what I mean by normal is \"no clinically significant abnormalities\", which is different from \"textbook normal.\" A prime example of this is abdominal radiographs on a patient with acute vomiting and diarrhea. Most of the time, I read these out as normal abdomen. The intern or ER doc may then come and ask, so these don't look like gastroenteritis? To which I ask, what are the radiographic signs of gastroenteritis? And they don't answer, because of course there aren't really any specific radiographic signs of gastroenteritis. I may see some things that I associate more often with gastroenteritis — fragmented gas pattern in the jejunum, diffuse gas dilation of the GI tract, etc. — and if the clinical history fits I may conclude acute gastroenteritis so the ordering clinician feels better about their workup. But in reality, those radiographic signs are pretty common in animals with no GI symptoms at all, so it wouldn't be wrong to just conclude \"normal abdomen.\" The goal of abdominal rads in the acutely vomiting animal is not to rule \\*\\*in\\*\\* gastroenteritis, it is to rule \\*\\*out\\*\\* mechanical obstruction, radiopaque foreign material, or other gross abnormalities like abdominal mass effect or ascites. \"Normal abdomen\" effectively rules those things out, leaving you with a provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis so long as the remainder of the clinical picture fits (i.e., not in acute renal failure, liver failure, Addisonian crisis, etc.). \n",
      "\n",
      "So ultimately this is where reading textbooks like Thrall is useful, even if the example images aren't amazing. You learn what the actual radiographic signs are that are classically associated with disease processes. There isn't really a better overall textbook out there than Thrall.

For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location.

      "The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.|A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be \"nonprofit\" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations.

Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org.

Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner.

      "\n",
      "In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio.

Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.|Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices.

      "Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.\n",

      "Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).|This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).|I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that.

They are generally customized for an individual resident, and the \"alternative\" aspect is usually that the supervising radiologists will be spread out over 2 or more institutions rather than all in one location. There is still a requirement that a residency director be on location at the primary hospital for at least 50% of the time, and at least one other supervising radiologist (but typically more than one) be available for immediate live clinical consultation/interaction the rest of the time (usually meaning the resident goes to a different hospital with a radiologist, or the other radiologist is a contracted locum at the primary hospital, but technically could also be a virtual locum on a Zoom call all day). \n",

Most who end up in that situation probably spent a lot of time carving out a custom path to it, with a decent amount of luck along the way, as opposed to following some well-established path hitting standard goalposts/benchmarks.|I wouldn't worry too much about being sued over something like that. Realistically, in order to lose a case like that, you'd have to have a radiologist willing to testify that your miss was a major error that affected the outcome of the case and that a general practitioner should be expected to identify. Any doctor, radiologist or not, who claims that loss of serosal detail in the right cranial quadrant is a sure sign of pancreatitis that shouldn't be missed is full of shit. As a radiologist, I am well aware of all the classical radiographic signs of pancreatitis, and anecdotally based on followup abdominal ultrasounds in these cases I can confidently say the classical signs of pancreatitis on radiographs are both poorly sensitive and poorly specific. I am generally actually hesitant to even teach people the radiographic signs, because it probably just means more vets will be misdiagnosing pancreatitis.\n",

      "What you should be worried about is making major radiologic errors, by which I mean a missed or misdiagnosed lesion which led directly to a negative outcome that could have been avoided with a proper diagnosis. Missing a GI obstruction would be an example. On the flip side, incorrectly diagnosing a GI obstruction leading to a negative surgical explore would arguably also be a major misdiagnosis. Without knowing your actual skill level at reading radiographs I don't know how concerned you should be about things like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as radiologists go, there's a recent paper out of the AMC looking at error rates among veterinary radiologists (at the AMC, anyways), and they had a 4.6% major error rate (i.e., radiologist messed up, leading to death of patient). That's, like, relatively high. So chances are non-radiologists would have a significantly higher rate of major errors. I still wouldn't be overly concerned about being sued, as your error would have to be pretty egregious for a radiologist to testify that you should be penalized for it, but as a matter of basic medical standard and patient care you should maybe be concerned. I would say most radiologists are at least a little concerned about a bad miss on any case we read.\n",

      "That is certainly a strategy you can take. Most radiologists are averse to negative explores, as that is pretty invasive. The \"old school\" approach was that if don't have a negative explore now and then, you're probably not doing enough surgeries. I think the more modern mindset is that every negative explore is a diagnostic failure. Cost of further diagnostics is certainly a consideration for our clients compared to human med, but if you had a complaint of vomiting and abdominal pain and went to the ER, and their initial imaging screening was inconclusive, I would bet you wouldn't seriously consider letting them do a diagnostic laparotomy on you in lieu of further imaging. I think so long as the pet owners understand that there are other noninvasive but perhaps less timely and more costly options available, and they are giving well informed consent to the exploratory, that's fine.|Challenging is very subjective and individual. I am a terrible surgeon, and so I would find being a surgeon quite challenging. I am also not very good at dealing with crashing patients and highly complex critical cases, so I would find ECC quite challenging.

      "\n",
      "Vet med is not a good field to go into for \"lucrative.\" In a vacuum it is, as most new graduates are now making in the $110K-150K range. But most new graduates also have between $150-400K in student loans, so their overall financial situation is not great. Veterinarians are also (I think) the lowest paid of the doctoral-level healthcare professionals (human physicians, dentists, pharmacists, etc.). I believe the average vet also makes similar or less than the average nurse practitioner or physician assistant, which require fewer years of training and therefore lower educational cost. \n",
      "\n",
      "Being an emergency veterinarian can be quite lucrative, especially if you work in a relatively high-cost urban or suburban area, likely averaging in the $200-250K range. And being a board-certified specialist also can be quite lucrative, likely in the $250-350K range. But that also requires at minimum an additional 4 years of post-graduate training, at very low salary. And equivalent-level MD specialists will still make around twice as much as the veterinary specialist (i.e., while a veterinary surgeon may make $350-400K, an MD surgeon will make $700-800K).|I am not a surgeon (I am a radiologist) but I will take a stab at some of your questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Applicants who have years of experience in lieu of a rotating internship are generally at a disadvantage. The key is what the nature of your experience is. If you're working for 3 years as an ER vet in a referral hospital with all the standard specialties that one would have at a rotating internship, that is good experience. If you're working for 2 years in a general practice with minimal to no direct exposure to (boarded) specialists, that's bad experience. \n",
      "2. An internship recognized by EBVS is *probably* valid, but I would guess it is viewed as second tier unless it is well enough known as to be internationally reputable.\n",
      "3. Recs from vets in the UK would hold weight, so long as the vets are boarded specialists. DACVS probably holds more weight than DECVS, but only by a little.\n",
      "4. I have no idea how you would get involved in publishing something at a private clinic. It really just depends on whether you have contact with a boarded specialist who is willing to co-author the paper with you.\n",
      "5. The surgery diploma may help a little bit, but not much. Any ACVS residency is likely to be quite skeptical of the diploma/certificate, since they don't really know how rigorous the criteria are for passing. It would likely simply be viewed as \"candidate demonstrates an interest in small animal surgery.\"\n",
      "6. GPA comparison is very challenging unless the residency happens to have a faculty surgeon who is familiar with your school. If a class rank is available and can be shared as part of your application, that may hold more weight than straight GPA.\n",
      "7. They won't skip over your application without ECFVG/NAVLE, but you are likely at some kind of disadvantage without it. Also note that without ECFVG/NAVLE, even if you pass your boards you would be restricted to working at a university teaching hospital in the US.\n",
      "8. The most important part of the residency application is your references. Ideally, if you can find a surgeon (or two) who are double boarded in ACVS and ECVS to write letters, that's the best thing you can do. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, the thing that residencies want to know is whether you will pass your boards and whether you will be a functional part of a surgery department for the 3 years of residency. The best way for them to know this is by having references from DACVS vets who know the candidate well and can vouch for their ability to survive a residency. This is the reason why DACVS references are preferred – they have been through the residency and passed the ACVS boards. DECVS may be perfectly knowledgeable and skilled surgeons, but they have not gone through an ACVS residency and passed those boards. There is an assumption that the two are probably close enough that a DECVS can evaluate whether a candidate is residency material, but again, if you have no DACVS references you are likely at a disadvantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the internship vs experience and the utility of the 1 year surgery diploma/certificate, ultimately the problem is that this is \"nontraditional\" for a candidate for an ACVS residency. There are many, many qualified applicants with a more traditional education/training background, many more than the number of residency spots. Last year, there were 238 applicants for 54 spots, with a match rate of 22.27%. More than 4 applicants for every 1 spot. And the vast majority of those applicants went to an AVMA-Accredited school, did a rotating internship in the US or Canada, and the vast majority of successful applicants also have one or more surgical internships as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "ACVS residencies have decided that this background – good grades at accredited school, rotating internship, surgical internship, multiple good DACVS references – is a good predictor of success for a resident. And there are more applicants who fit this profile than there are residency spots. So for you to supplant one of those candidates as a Spanish vet school grad, with no rotating internship, no surgical internship, and no DACVS references, you basically have to be a total rock star of a surgery candidate, and your DECVS references will need to say so emphatically.|\"Recognized\" is a nebulous word. Because vet med is minimally regulated in the US, anybody can do anything once they have a license. There are plenty of self-styled orthopedic \"specialists\" who have never been through a residency and are certainly not board-certified surgeons. But are boarded European specialists generally considered equivalent to the American specialist counterparts? Yes. At least in radiology, for example, a DECVDI is counted as a DACVR equivalent for the purpose of ACVR residency accreditation. Mind you, we are talking about boarded specialists here, not the Advanced Practitioner certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "To work as a vet in the US, you either have to have passed your NAVLE, or you have to work under the umbrella license of a university teaching hospital. This applies to boarded specialists as well. Having a DECVS or DECVDI does not allow you to bypass the need for a valid medical license. So if you are a DECVS who has not passed the NAVLE (either directly or after having gone through ECFVG or PAVE certification first), your only option is to work at a university. That said, there are many such European specialists working at universities, because academia pays like crap so it's hard to attract and retain faculty. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think that if your general vet med education is still fresh in your mind, and your plan (being a US citizen) is to live/work in the US permanently, it would be advisable to go through the ECFVG. Even with the cost, you will make a LOT more money if you have the ability to work in private practice, whether as a GP, an ER vet, or a specialist.|As many have already noted, the salary is pretty low. $125K is the mean starting salary for 2023 new graduates in private practice. Mean/average salary, meaning a very significant number of new grads are making more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond that, though, what is the clinic organization and working conditions? 20% ownership at signing and \"can change the name to whatever they want\" suggests this new employee has immediate full control of the practice itself. To me this sounds like there's one vet who owns the clinic is looking to retire, allowing the new vet to rename/rebrand however they like. Most people these days are looking to work in a larger team environment, as opposed to being effectively a solo practitioner. This also begs the question of how many support staff are there for the X number of vets? Especially how many RVTs, how many VAs, how many kennel attendants, how many receptionists, and is there a practice manager?|There are no reliable data, that I'm aware of. And salaries across the board in vet med have changed drastically since the pandemic, so any data you find from 2020 or earlier is likely so outdated as to be totally useless at this point. There may be internal data within the cardiology college (ACVIM) but I am not privy to it if so. \n",
      "\n",
      "Generally speaking, cardiologists are in high demand and make a lot of money. Especially if you decide to work as a mobile practitioner, and even more so if you learn basic abdominal ultrasound and add that to your mobile services. As a basic rule of thumb, simply by being in a major clinical specialty, you probably will be making $250K at bare minimum. I would guess the average cardiologist makes around $350K, and I personally know cardiologists making over $400K, which is probably mid-upper range for private practice. I would not be surprised if mobile cardiologists are making $500K+. This is all wild speculation, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Academia is a totally different ballgame, and most likely the average academic cardiologist makes $100-150K, basically the same as a private practice GP. You'll make more as you move up the ladder towards full professor/tenure, but that is quite a slog. Basically, the only reasons to work in academia would be:\n",
      "\n",

And then ideally wherever you do an internship there will also be many additional specialists.|Yes, basically any larger referral hospital or teaching hospital with a radiology department (i.e., has radiologists on staff) will have full time techs working in the radiology department. Veterinary radiology tech backgrounds run the gamut: vet assistants who are trained on-the-job to acquire imaging studies, registered vet techs (RVT) who are trained on-the-job and who may progress to vet tech specialization (VTS, involves benchmarks for experience and then passing a certifying exam), human medical radiologic technologists (RT) who shift to vet med part time or full time, human medical registered diagnostic medical sonographers (RDMS) who shift to vet med part time or full time. \n",

So if we assume 10% interest rate (which is higher than it is right now, I think), over 7 years you accrue $106k on a $270k loan, bringing you up to $376k when you finish in the US. On a $400k loan over 5 years at 10%, you accrue $109k in interest, putting you at $509k when you finish in the UK. That's a difference of $133k.

Also whatever is that actual interest rate you get will make a big difference.
